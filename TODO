                                              W3C Sample Code Library TODO List
   W3Clibwww
   
   This is the current work plan for new features and changed interfaces for
   libwww. You can also have a look at release notes for the latest release and
   the change history for older releases.
   
   We are moving to the Java platform pretty soon but some of the stuff that we

                         The current PEP Implementation does not contain all
                         the features described in the latest draft
                         
  Byte range requests    This is a "poor man's:" multiplexing but with better
                         semantic understanding of what is going on as it is
                         handled in application space
                         
  MUX Implementation     The MUX Implementation is being worked on. We need to
                         get some performance figures for how it performs.
