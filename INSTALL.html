  Libwww - the W3C Sample Code Library Installation
</H1>
<PRE>
 	(c) COPYRIGHT MIT 1995.
 	Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.
 
</PRE>
<P>
These installation instructions are based on the suggested instructions provided
with <A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/autoconf/">GNU Autoconf</A>.
<P>
The <I>configure</I> shell script attempts to guess correct values for various
system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those values
to create a `Makefile' and a `config.h' file containing system-dependent
definitions. <B></B>Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring,
and a file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for debugging
<I>configure</I>).
<H2>
  Building on Windows
</H2>
<P>
Building on Windows is somewhat different than building on Unix. We therefore
have a separate set of directions for doing this. We maintain a set of Microsoft
Visual C make files which can be used directly if you want to use this compiler.
We do not support help on any type of Windows based compiler including msvc,
so be warned!

<P>
Stop here and jump to the <A HREF="Library/User/Patch/">Known Bugs and
Patches</A> page to see if you need to apply any patches before you compile.
You can find some options determining how libwww is going to be compiled
in the special <A HREF="Library/src/windows/config.h">windows config.h
file</A>.
<H3>
  ZLib Support
</H3>
<P>
One of the options in the <A HREF="Library/src/windows/config.h">windows
config.h file</A> is to determine whether you want to use the
<A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/">zlib library</A> for handling
the <B>deflate</B> content-encoding. This may cause better performance as
we then can inflate a compressed document on the fly. A version of the
precompiled <A HREF="http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/">zlib DLL for Win32</A>
is already included in the w3c-libwww distribution file and you can find
it in
<PRE>	.../w3c-libwww-5.1/Library/External
 
</PRE>
<P>
Make sure that your system knows about DLLs in this directory or that you
move the zlib.dll to another location. Otherwise you will not be able to
run the application as zlib DLL can not be found.
<H3>
  Detailed Installation
</H3>
<P>
If you are interested in the details of how we build libwww on windows then
please continue by reading the special documentation on
<A HREF="Library/User/Platform/WinDLL.html">how to install on Windows</A>.
<H2>
  Building on Unix
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Icons/32x32/caution" ALT="Note" BORDER="0" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32">
You probably need the <A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/make/">GNU
version of make</A> in order to build libwww. The reason is that some of
the make files contain some syntax that most other makefiles don't understand.
<P>
The simplest way to compile this package on a Unix platform is:
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
    `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
    `<CODE>./configure</CODE>' to configure the package for your system. If you're
    using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type `<CODE>sh
    ./configure</CODE>' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
    <I>configure</I> itself. Running <I>configure</I> takes awhile. While running,
    it prints some messages telling which features for which it is checking.
  <LI>
    Stop here and jump to the <A HREF="Library/User/Patch/">Known Bugs and
    Patches</A> page to see if you need to apply any patches before you compile.
  <LI>
    Type `make' to compile the package.
  <LI>
    Type `make install' to install the library.
  <LI>
    You can remove the library and object files from the source directory by
    typing `make clean.' To also remove the files that <I>configure</I> created
    (so you can compile the package for a different kind of computer), type `make
    distclean.'
</OL>
<H2>
  Compilers and Options
</H2>
<P>
Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
<I>configure</I> script does not know about. You can give <I>configure</I>
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment. Using a
Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like this:
<PRE>
      CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
 
</PRE>
<P>
Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
<PRE>
      env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
 
</PRE>
<H2>
  Using a Different Build Directory
</H2>
<P>
You can compile the package in a directory different from the one containing
the source code. Doing so allows you to compile it on more than one kind
of computer at the same time. To do this, you must use a version of `make'
that supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make.' `cd' to the directory
where you want to object files and library to go and run the <I>configure</I>
script (i.e., go `../src/configure'). <I>configure</I> automatically checks
for source code in the directory that <I>configure</I> is in and in `..'
as well.
<H2>
  Installation Names
</H2>
<P>
By default, `<CODE>make install</CODE>' will install the library in
`<CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE>'. You can specify an installation prefix other
than `/usr/local' by giving <I>configure</I> the option
`<CODE>--prefix=PATH</CODE>'. You can cause the library to be installed with
an extra prefix or suffix on its name by giving <I>configure</I> the options
`<CODE>--program-prefix=PREFIX</CODE>' or
`<CODE>--program-suffix=SUFFIX</CODE>'.
<H2>
  <A NAME="features">Optional Features and Packages</A>
</H2>
<P>

Autoconf <I>configure</I></A> scripts:

</DL>
<H2>
  Specifying the System Type
</H2>
<P>
There may be some features <I>configure</I> can not figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of host the package will run on. Usually
<I>configure</I> can figure that out, but if it prints a message saying it
can not guess the host type, give it the `--host=TYPE' option. TYPE can either
be a short name for the system type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name
with three fields:
<PRE>
      CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
 
</PRE>
<P>
See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field. If `config.sub'
isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't need to know the
host type.
<P>
If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also use
the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will produce
code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of system on which
you are compiling the package.
<H2>
  Sharing Defaults
</H2>
<P>
If you want to set default values for <I>configure</I> scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'. <I>configure</I>
looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then `PREFIX/etc/config.site'
if it exists. Or, you can set the `CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the
location of the site script. A warning: not all <I>configure</I> scripts
look for a site script.
<H2>
  Operation Controls
</H2>
<P>
<I>configure</I> recognizes the following options to control how it operates.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <CODE>--cache-file=FILE</CODE>
  <DD>
    Save the results of the tests in FILE instead of `config.cache'. Set FILE
    to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for debugging <I>configure</I>.
  <DT>
    <CODE>--help</CODE>
  <DD>
    Print a summary of the options to <I>configure</I>, and exit.
  <DT>
    <CODE>--quiet</CODE>, <CODE>--silent</CODE>
  <DD>
    Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.
  <DT>
    <CODE>--srcdir=DIR</CODE>
  <DD>
    Look for the package's source code in directory DIR. Usually <I>configure</I>
    can determine that directory automatically.
  <DT>
    <CODE>--version</CODE>
  <DD>
    Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the <I>configure</I> script,
    and exit.
</DL>
<P>
<I>configure</I> also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
