  The W3C libwww Web Commander GUI Tool
</H1>
<P>
<DIV class="intro">
  <B>WinCom</B> is a sample MS Windows 95/NT GUI application for saving documents
  remotely using HTTP/1.1. It allows the user to explicitly control the
  metainformation describing the document to save including the language, type,
  charset, etc. The Web Commander is part of the the libwww - the
  <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Sample Code Library</A> and is available in both
  source and binary versions.

  <A NAME="Binary">Binary Installation Guide</A>
</H2>
<P>
Because Windows makefiles are such a pain to handle, I have made an exception
and provided a binary version of the Web Commander. In order to install the
binary version, complete the following steps:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Download the <A HREF="WinCom.zip">latest precompiled binary version</A>
  <LI>
    Unzip the distribution file into your preferred location. All files in the
    zip file are packaged under the "<TT>bin</TT>" folder, so you may want to
    extract it into <TT>C:\</TT>, for example. That way, the Web Commander will
    end up as "<TT>C:\bin\WinCom.exe</TT>".
  <LI>
    There is no installation wizard, but if you want to make a desktop shortcut
    then you can make a shortcut in the "<TT>bin</TT>" folder and drag it to
    the desktop.
  <LI>
    If ever you want to uninstall the Web Commander then just delete the
    "<TT>bin</TT>" folder (make sure that you don't have anything else there,
    of course)
