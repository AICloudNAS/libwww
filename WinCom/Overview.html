  <A NAME="Binary">Binary Installation Guide</A>
</H2>
<P>
As an exception, the Web Commander is provided in a binary version as well
as in source. In order to install the binary version, complete the following
steps:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Download the <A HREF="WinCom.zip">latest precompiled binary version</A>
  <LI>
    Unzip the distribution file into your preferred location. All files in the
    zip file are packaged under the "<TT>bin</TT>" folder, so you may want to
    extract it into <TT>C:\</TT>, for example. That way, the Web Commander will
    end up as "<TT>C:\bin\WinCom.exe</TT>".
  <LI>
    There is no installation wizard, but if you want to make a desktop shortcut
    then you can make a shortcut in the "<TT>bin</TT>" folder and drag it to
    the desktop.
  <LI>
    If ever you want to uninstall the Web Commander then just delete the
    "<TT>bin</TT>" folder (make sure that you don't have anything else there,
    of course)
