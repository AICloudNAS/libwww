  Web Commander Help and Screen Shots
</H1>
<P>
The following screen shots are PNG images - if your browser doesn't understand
the <A HREF="/TR/png">PNG image format</A> then they will show up as broken
images.

  Saving a Document
</H3>
<P>
The document that you want to save on your favorite HTTP/1.1 editing server
can either reside on your local disk, on an FTP server, or on an HTTP server.
Note that Web Commander can handle any type of document including binary
formats, tar files, programs, etc.

  Solving Version Conflicts
</H3>
<P>
If somebody has saved an updated version of the same document that you are
trying to save, Web Commander detects it and asks you what to do.

This feature can be turned on and off under the Options menu.

  Loading a Document
</H3>
<P ALIGN=Left>
You can also use Web Commander to simply load a document either from an HTTP
server or an FTP server. The cache directives can help you reloading a document
that you know has been changed in the mean time. Normally you can just use
the default setting which is to get the nearest version that appears fresh.

  Deleting a Document
</H3>
<P>
Web Commander can be used to delete a document on an HTTP server

  Proxy Setup and SSH Tunnelling
</H3>
<P>
The proxy setup is very flexible as you can use regular expressions to say
which request should go there. In this example, all requests going to
<TT>http://jigedit.w3.org/*</TT> are tunnelled through a local host SSH tunnel
ensuring real security. You can also do things like proxying all requests
ending in "<TT>.png</TT>" though a particular proxy.

<P>
It could of course also be a normal HTTP proxy sitting on a firewall.
