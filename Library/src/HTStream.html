<H1>Stream Object definition</H1>A Stream object is something which
accepts a stream of text.<P>
The creation methods will vary on
the type of Stream Object, but the
methods used to write to it and close
it are common.

</PRE>These are the common methods of all
streams.  They should be self-explanatory,
except for end_document which must
be called before free.  It should
be merged with free in fact:  it
should be dummy for new streams.
