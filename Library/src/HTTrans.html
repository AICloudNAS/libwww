<H1>Transport Protocols</H1>

</PRE>

This module keeps a list of transport methods with associated access
code. New transport protocols may be registered at any time. This
allows the application to easily hook in its own transport layers. The
purpose of the <CODE>HTTransport</CODE> object is to contain transport
dependent methods for opening and closing a connection to the
transport and also to get an input stream and an output strean for
reading and writing to the transport respectively.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTTrans.c">HTTrans.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>

<PRE>
#ifndef HTTRANS_H
#define HTTRANS_H
</PRE>

All the transports supported directly by the Library can be initiated
using the function <CODE>HTTransportInit()</CODE> in <A
HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit module</A><P>

<H2>The Transport Object</H2>

All transport interfaces are registered dynamically in libwww. This
means that libwww is independent of the transport being used (for
example TCP) and you can therefore use libwww in any context you
like. You have to specify a set of parameters in order for libwww to
be able to use it. The transport class is defined as follows:

<PRE>
typedef struct _HTTransport HTTransport;

#include "HTIOStream.h"
#include "HTChannl.h"
</PRE>

<H3>Add a Transport</H3>

A new transport can be registered at any time in the Library. You must
specify a name ad the supported channel mode that the transport
supports. Then you must also register two creation methods of an input
and an output stream respectively. You can find the definition of the
I/O streams in the <A HREF="HTIOStream.html">HTIOStream module</A>.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTransport_add (const char *		name,
			     HTChannelMode		mode,
			     HTInput_new *		get_input,
			     HTOutput_new *		get_output);
</PRE>

<H3>Delete a Transport</H3>

This functions deletes a registered protocol module so that it can not
be used for accessing a resource anymore.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTransport_delete (const char * name);
</PRE>

<H3>Remove ALL Registered Transports</H3>

This is the garbage collection function. It is called by <A
HREF="HTAccess.html#Library">HTLibTerminate()</A>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTransport_deleteAll (void);
</PRE>

<H3>Find a Transport Protocol Object</H3>

You can search the list of registered protocol objects as a function
of the access acheme. If an access scheme is found then the protocol
object is returned.

<PRE>
extern HTTransport * HTTransport_find (HTRequest * request, const char * name);
</PRE>

<H3>Supported Mode</H3>

A transport object is registered with the <A
HREF="HTChannl.html">channel mode </A>that it supports.

<PRE>
extern HTChannelMode HTTransport_mode (HTTransport * tp);
</PRE>

<H3>Input and Output Stream Creation Methods</H3>

<PRE>
struct _HTTransport {
    char *		name;
    HTChannelMode	mode;			   /* Channel mode supported */
    HTInput_new *	input_new; 	     /* Input stream creation method */
    HTOutput_new *	output_new;	    /* Output stream creation method */
};
