<H1>C File Writer</H1>It is useful to have both FWriter
and Writer for environments in which
fdopen() doesn't exist for example.<P>
Part of <A
NAME="z1" HREF="Overview.html">libwww</A> . Implemented by <A
NAME="z0" HREF="HTFWriter.c">HTFWriter.c</A>

HTSaveAndCallBack will save to a
cache file and call the request->callback
function with the filename as parameter.

<H2><A
NAME="z3">The cache</A></H2>The cache contains details of temporary
disk files which contain the contents
of remote documents.   There is also
a <A
NAME="z2" HREF="HTAnchor.html#z1">list of cache items for each URL</A>
in its anchor object.
<H3>An item in the cache</H3>
<PRE>typedef struct _HTCacheItem {
    HTParentAnchor *	anchor;
    HTFormat		format;		/* May have many formats per anchor */
    char *		filename;
    time_t		load_time;
    time_t		load_delay;
    int			reference_count;
} HTCacheItem;

</PRE>
<H3>The Cache Itself</H3>There is one global cache. No, it's
not reentrant code then.  If we find
a use for >1 cache then we can change
it. Currently the obvious advantage
is when all things which could gain
from caching use the same one.
<PRE>extern HTList * HTCache;	/* made up of HTCacheItem items */

</PRE>
<H3>The Cache Limit</H3>The cache limit is the number of
files which are kept. Yes, I know,
the amount of disk space wouldbe
more relevant. So this may change.
Currentlyit is present to 100 but
may be changed by the application
by writing into this variable.
<PRE>extern int	HTCacheLimit;

<H3>Clear a cache</H3>
<PRE>extern void HTCacheClear PARAMS((HTList * cache));

</PRE>
<H3>Stream for writing to cache</H3>Note that HTSaveAndCallBack will
also generate a cache file.
