It is useful to have both FWriter and Writer for environments in which
<CODE>fdopen()</CODE> doesn't exist for example. The module contains
the following parts:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#utils">Basic Utility Streams</A>
<LI><A HREF="#write">An ANSI C File Writer Stream</A>
<LI><A HREF="#converters">Various Converters using the File Writer Stream</A>
</UL>


This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTFWrite.c">HTFWrite.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>.

<H2><A NAME="write">An ANSI C File Writer Stream</A></H2>

This function puts up a new stream given an open file descripter. If the file
is not to be closed afterwards, then set leave_open = NO.

<PRE>
extern HTStream * HTFWriter_new	(HTRequest * request,
				 FILE * fp,
				 BOOL leave_open);
</PRE>

<A NAME="converters"><H2>Various Converters using the File Writer
Stream</H2></A>

This is a set of functions that can be registered as converters. They
all use the basic ANSI C file writer stream for writing out to the
local file system.

<PRE>
extern HTConverter HTSaveAndExecute, HTSaveLocally, HTSaveAndCallback;
</PRE>

<DL>

<DT><CODE>HTSaveLocally</CODE>
<DD>Saves a file to local disk. This can for example be used to dump
date objects of unknown media types to local disk. The stream prompts
for a file name for the temporary file.

<DT><CODE>HTSaveAndExecute</CODE>

<DD>Creates temporary file, writes to it and then executes system
command (maybe an external viewer) when EOF has been reached. The
stream finds a suitable name of the temporary file which preserves the
suffix. This way, the system command can find out the file type from
the name of the temporary file name.

<DT><CODE>HTSaveAndCallback</CODE>

<DD>This stream works exactly like the <CODE>HTSaveAndExecute</CODE>
stream but in addition when EOF has been reached, it checks whether a
callback function has been associated with the request object in which
case, this callback is being called. This can be use by the
application to do some processing <EM>after</EM> the system command
has terminated. The callback function is called with the file name of
the temporary file as parameter.

</DL>

<A NAME="tmp"><H3>Location of Temporary Files</H3></A>

The destination for temporary files can be managed by the following
functions:

<PRE>
extern BOOL  HTTmp_setRoot		(const char * tmp_root);
extern const char * HTTmp_getRoot	(void);
extern void  HTTmp_freeRoot		(void);
</PRE>

The <CODE>HTTmp_freeRoot</CODE> is called by the <A
HREF="HTReq.html#Library">HTLibTerminate</A> function. The default
value is defined in <A HREF="HTAccess.html#Addresses">HTReq.html</A>
