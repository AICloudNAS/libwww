<H1>WAIS protocol interface</H1>This module does not actually perform
the WAIS protocol directly, but it
does using one or more library of
the WAIS distribution. The ui.a library
came with the old free WAIS from
TMC,  the client.a and wais.a libraries
are needed from the freeWAIS from
CNIDR.<P>
If you include this module in the
library, you must also
<UL>
<LI>Register the HTWAIS protocol at initialisation
(e.g. HTInit or HTSInit) by compiling
it with -DDIRECT_WAIS
<LI>Link with the libraries
</UL>The wais source files are parsed
by a sepaarte and independent module,
HTWSRC.   You can include WSRC without
including direct wais using this
module, and your WWW code will be
able to read source files, and access
WAIS indexes through a gateway.<P>
Anyways, this interface won't change
much:
<PRE>#ifndef HTWAIS_H
#define HTWAIS_H
#include "HTUtils.h"
#include "HTAccess.h"

extern HTProtocol HTWAIS;

#endif
