This module defines the read and write functions to and from the
network. As we are having reentrant function and a smarter network I/O
this will get very small :-) <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTReader.c">HTReader.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>.

<H2>Input Buffering</H2>

In order to optimize reading a channel, we bind a buffer to each
channel object. The size of this buffer is a compromise between speed
and memory. Here it is chosen as the default TCP High Water Mark
(sb_hiwat) for receiving data. By default, we have chosen a value that
equals the normal TCP High Water Mark (sb_hiwat) for receiving data.
