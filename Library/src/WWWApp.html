<H1>Non-Mandatory Application Include File</H1>

In addition top the basic W3C Reference Library include file called <A
HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> you <EM>can</EM> also include this
file called WWWApp.h depending on the needs of your
application. However, it is not required and none of the files
included below are ever used in the core part of the Library
itself. Only if this file is included, the extra modules will get
included in the linked object code. It is also possible to include
only a subset of the files below if the functionality you are after is
covered by them.

<H2>Initialization</H2>

The core parts of the Library is a framework for adding
functionality. It has hooks for adding protocol modules, like for
example HTTP, FTP, and also for adding streams that can convert from
one media type to some other type, or presenting the result to the
user. In the distribution file of the Library you will find a large
set of protocol modules and streams already implemented. However, in
order to use these you need to initialize them. This can be done by
using the files in the <A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit</A> module. You
can modify this module as you like to fit your particular needs.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit.h</A>"

<H3>Generating the First Anchor</H3>

This module provides some "make life easier" functions in order to get
the application going. They help you generate the first anchor, also
called the <EM>home anchor</EM>. It also contains a nice set of
default WWW addresses.

<H2>Before a Request</H2>

When a request has been issued there are a number of things that an
application might want to do with the request before it actually goes
on the wire, for example to talk to a remote HTTP server. Examples are
checking if the object already is kept in a cache managed by the
application, if the request should be redirected to a proxy or a
gateway, or there is some other kind of translation of the URL taking
place. The Library provides a variety of modules that handles many
common place translations such as <EM>redirection of URLs</EM> and
<EM>caching</EM>.<P>

These modules are not part of the <A HREF="WWWCore.html">Library
Core</A> as the registration process depends on the application. It
can for example use a database or some other means of registering
translation rules, proxy servers. etc. The Library implementations are
deliberately made as platform independent as possible and will cover
most situations. You can find a function called
<CODE>HTLoadStart</CODE> in the <A HREF="HTHome.html">HTHome module</A>
that enables all the functionality for translating URLs.

<H3>Rule File Management</H3>

Another way to initialize applications is to use a rule file, also
known as a configuration file. This is for example the case with the
W3C httpd and the W3C Line Mode Browser. This module provides basic
support for configuration file management and the application can use
this is desired. The module is not referred to by the Library. Reading
a rule file is implemented as a stream converter so that a rule file
can come from anywhere, even across the network!

<H3>Proxies and Gateways</H3>

Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols,
they can in many situations rely on the support of proxies and
gateways to help doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to carry
client requests through a firewall where they can provide services
like corporate caching and other network optimizations. Both Proxy
servers and gateways can serve as "protocol translators" which can
convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP, to an equivalent
request in another protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher. In case
a proxy server or a gateway is available to the application, it can
therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy
server which then handle the communications with the remote server,
for example using FTP about the document and return it to the
application (proxy client) using HTTP.

<H3>Cache Manager</H3>

Caching is a required part of any efficient Internet access
applications as it saves bandwidth and improves access performance
significantly in almost all types of accesses.  The Library supports
two different types of cache: The memory cache and the file cache. The
two types differ in several ways which reflects their two main
purposes: The memory cache is for short term storage of graphic
objects whereas the file cache is for intermediate term storage of
data objects. Often it is desirable to have both a memory and a file
version of a cached document, so the two types do not exclude each
other.

#include "<A HREF="HTCache.html">HTCache.h</A>"

<H2>After a Request</H2>

When a request is terminated, the application often has to do some
action as a result of the request (and of the result of the
request). The Application part of the Library provides two following
modules to handle <EM>logging</EM> and <EM>history
management</EM>. You can register a <EM>POST request handler</EM> in
the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net Manager</A> as described in the <A
HREF="../User/Using/Overview.html">User's Guide</A>. <P>

You can find a function called <CODE>HTLoadTerminate</CODE> in the <A
HREF="HTHome.html">HTHome module</A> that enables all the functionality
for handling a request result.

<H3>Logging</H3>

Often it is required to log the requests issued to the Library. This
can either be the case if the application is a server or it can also
be useful in a client application. This module provides a simple
logging mechanism which can be enabled if needed.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTLog.html">HTLog.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>History Management</H3>

Another type of logging is keeping track of which documents a user has
visited when browsing along on the Web. The Library history manager
provides a basic set of functionality to keep track of a linear
history list.
