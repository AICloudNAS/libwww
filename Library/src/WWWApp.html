<H1>Application Specific Include File for W3C Reference Library</H1>

In addition top the basic W3C Reference Library include file called <A
HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> you <EM>can</EM> also include this
file called WWWApp.h depending on the needs of your
application. However, it is not required and none of the files
included below are ever used in the core part of the Library
itself. Only if this file is included, the extra modules will get
included in the linked object code. It is also possible to include
only a subset of the files below if the functionality you are after is
covered by them.

<H2>Initialization</H2>

The core parts of the Library is a framework for adding
functionailty. It has hooks for adding protocol modules, like for
example HTTP, FTP, and also for adding streams that can convert from
one media type to some other type, or presenting the result to the
user. In the distribution file of the Library you will find a large
set of porotocol modules and streams already implemented. However, in
order to use these you need to initialize them. This can be done by
using the files in the <A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit</A> module. You
can modify this module as you like to fit your particular needs.

<PRE>
#include "HTInit.h"			/* Initialization functions */
</PRE>

<H2>Logging</H2>

Often it is required to log the requests issued to the Library. This
can either be the case if the application is a server or it can also
be useful in a client application. This module provides a simple
logging mechanism which can be enabled if needed.

<PRE>
#include "HTLog.h"
</PRE>

<H2>History Management</H2>

Another type of logging is keeping track of which documents a user has
visited when browsing along on the Web. The Library history manager
provides a basic set of functionality to keep track of a linear
history list.

#include "HTHist.h"			/* Navigational aids */
