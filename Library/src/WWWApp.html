<P>
In addition top the basic W3C Reference Library include file called
<A HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> you <EM>can</EM> also include this file
called WWWApp.h depending on the needs of your application. However, it is
not required and none of the files included below are ever used in the core
part of the Library itself. Only if this file is included, the extra modules
will get included in the linked object code. It is also possible to include
only a subset of the files below if the functionality you are after is covered
by them.

  System dependencies
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="sysdep.html">sysdep.h</A> file includes system-specific include
files and flags for I/O to network and disk. The only reason for this file
is that the Internet world is more complicated than Posix and ANSI.

  Event Manager
</H2>
<P>
The core part of libwww only provides the hooks for the event manager. There
is no event loop internal to the core part. Instead the application must
provide the event loop in order to use either pseudo threads or real threads.
If the application only uses blocking sockets without threads then it is
not required to register any event loop at all. We provide a default
implementation of an event loop which you can either take or get some ideas
from.

  Specific MIME Header Parsers
</H2>
<P>
The Library's MIME parser is divided into two parts: A generic MIME parser
that knows how to unwrap all RFC822 headers and specialized header parsers
that knows how to parse <CODE>Content-Length</CODE>, for example. This is
the default set of the specialized MIME header parsers that can be registered
as part of the generic MIME. Note that these functions are not registered
by default - they must be registered by the application. This can be done
using the <A HREF="HTInit.html">HTMIMEInit()</A> function in the
<A HREF="WWWInit.html">WWWInit interface</A>. Of course this can also be
used to register new headers that are not represented below - or if you want
to replace a default parser then this is also very easy.

  Managing the Home Anchor
</H2>
<P>
This module provides some "make life easier" functions in order to get the
application going. They help you generate the first anchor, also called the
<EM>home anchor</EM>. It also contains a nice set of default WWW addresses.
<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTHome.html">HTHome.h</A>"
</PRE>
<H2>
  User Dialogs and Messages
</H2>
<P>
You can register a set of callback functions to handle user prompting, error
messages, confimations etc. Here we give a set of functions that can be used
on almost anu thinkable platform. If you want to provide your own platform
dependent implementation then fine :-)
<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTDialog.html">HTDialog.h</A>"
</PRE>
<H2>
  Load, Upload, and Search URLs
</H2>
<P>
Even though you may use the API for the HTRequest object directly in order
to issue a request, you will probably find that in real life it is easier
to use a higher level abstraction API. This API is provided by the
<A HREF="HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A> where you will find all kind
of functions for down loading a URL etc.
<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTAccess.html">HTAccess.h</A>"
</PRE>
<H2>
  After Terminating a Request
</H2>
<P>
When a request is terminated, the application often has to do some action
as a result of the request (and of the result of the request). The Application
part of the Library provides two following modules to handle <EM>logging</EM>
and <EM>history management</EM>. You can register a <EM>POST request
handler</EM> in the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net Manager</A> as described in
the <A HREF="../User/Using/Overview.html">User's Guide</A>.
<P>
You can find a function called <CODE>HTLoadTerminate</CODE> in the
<A HREF="HTHome.html">HTHome module</A> that enables all the functionality
for handling a request result.
<H3>
  Logging
</H3>
<P>
Often it is required to log the requests issued to the Library. This can
either be the case if the application is a server or it can also be useful
in a client application. This module provides a simple logging mechanism
which can be enabled if needed.
<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTLog.html">HTLog.h</A>"
</PRE>
<H3>
  History Management
</H3>
<P>
Another type of logging is keeping track of which documents a user has visited
when browsing along on the Web. The Library history manager provides a basic
set of functionality to keep track of a linear history list.
