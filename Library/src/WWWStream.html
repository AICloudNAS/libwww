<H1>Declaration of W3C Reference Library Streams</H1>

<PRE>
/*
**	(c) COPYRIGHT MIT 1995.
**	Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.
*/
</PRE>

The stream part of the Library is a set of streams that can be used in
many contexts throughout the Library.

extern "C" {

</PRE>

<H2>System dependencies</H2>

The <A HREF="sysdep.html">sysdep.h</A> file includes system-specific include
files and flags for I/O to network and disk. The only reason for this
file is that the Internet world is more complicated than Posix and
ANSI.

#include "sysdep.h"

<H2>Stream Modules</H2>

These are the streams describing this interface

<H3>Content Length Counter</H3>

This stream also buffers the result to find out the content length.
If a maximum buffer limit is reached Content-Length is calculated for
logs but it is not sent to the client -- rather the buffer is flushed
right away.

<PRE>
#include "HTConLen.h"			/* Content Length Counter */
</PRE>

<H3>Content Guess Stream</H3>

This interface provides functionality for guessing unknown media types
from magic words. The stream is a one that reads first a chunk of
stuff, tries to figure out the format, and calls
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This is a kind of lazy-evaluation of
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This could be extended arbitrarily to
recognize all the possible file formats in the world, if someone only
had time to do it. <P>

<PRE>
#include "HTGuess.h"			/* Guess stream */
</PRE>

<H3>Tee Stream</H3>

The Tee stream just writes everything you put into it into two oter
streams. One use (the only use?!) is for taking a cached copey on disk
while loading the main copy, without having to wait for the disk copy
to be finished and reread it.

<PRE>
#include "HTTee.h"			/* T streem for splitting a stream */
</PRE>

<H3>Memory Buffer</H3>

This version of the stream object is a hook for clients that want an
unparsed stream from libwww. The HTXParse_put_* and HTXParse_write
routines copy the content of the incoming buffer into a buffer that is
realloced whenever necessary. This buffer is handed over to the client
in HTXParse_free. See also <A HREF="HTFWrite.html">HTFWriter</A> for
writing to C files.

<PRE>
#include "HTXParse.h"			/* External parse stream */
</PRE>

<PRE>
#ifdef __cplusplus
} /* end extern C definitions */
