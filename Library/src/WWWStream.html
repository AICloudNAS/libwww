<P>
The stream part of the Library is a set of streams that can be used in many
contexts throughout the Library.

  System dependencies
</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="sysdep.html">sysdep.h</A> file includes system-specific include
files and flags for I/O to network and disk. The only reason for this file
is that the Internet world is more complicated than Posix and ANSI.

#include "sysdep.h"

  Content Length Counter
</H3>
<P>
This stream also buffers the result to find out the content length. If a
maximum buffer limit is reached Content-Length is calculated for logs but
it is not sent to the client -- rather the buffer is flushed right away.

  Content Guess Stream
</H3>
<P>
This interface provides functionality for guessing unknown media types from
magic words. The stream is a one that reads first a chunk of stuff, tries
to figure out the format, and calls <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This is
a kind of lazy-evaluation of <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This could be
extended arbitrarily to recognize all the possible file formats in the world,
if someone only had time to do it.

#include "<A HREF="HTGuess.html">HTGuess.h</A>"			/* Guess stream */

  Tee Stream
</H3>
<P>
The Tee stream just writes everything you put into it into two oter streams.
One use (the only use?!) is for taking a cached copey on disk while loading
the main copy, without having to wait for the disk copy to be finished and
reread it.
<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTTee.html">HTTee.h</A>"			/* T streem for splitting a stream */

  Memory Buffer
</H3>
<P>
This version of the stream object is a hook for clients that want an unparsed
stream from libwww. The HTXParse_put_* and HTXParse_write routines copy the
content of the incoming buffer into a buffer that is realloced whenever
necessary. This buffer is handed over to the client in HTXParse_free. See
also <A HREF="HTFWrite.html">HTFWriter</A> for writing to C files.
