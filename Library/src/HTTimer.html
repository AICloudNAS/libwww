<P>
The Timer class handles timer for libwww and the application. This works
exactly as in X where you create a timer object with a callback function
and a timeout. The callback will be called every time the timer expires.
<PRE>
#ifndef HTTIMER_H
#define HTTIMER_H

#include "wwwsys.h"
#include "HTReq.h"

typedef struct _HTTimer HTTimer;

typedef int HTTimerCallback (HTTimer *, void *, HTEventType type);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Create and Delete Timers
</H2>
<P>
The callback function is the function that is to be called when timer expires.
<PRE>
extern HTTimer * HTTimer_new (HTTimer *, HTTimerCallback *, 
			      void *, ms_t millis,
                              BOOL relative, BOOL repetitive);
extern BOOL HTTimer_delete (HTTimer * timer);
extern BOOL HTTimer_deleteAll (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Dispatch Timer
</H2>
<P>
Just do it
<PRE>
extern int HTTimer_dispatch (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Get the next timer in line
</H3>
<P>
Dispatches all expired timers and optionally returns the time till the next
one.
<PRE>
extern int HTTimer_next (ms_t * pSoonest);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Reset an already existing Repetitive Timer
</H3>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTimer_refresh(HTTimer * timer, ms_t now);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Get Information about a Timer Object
</H2>
<H3>
  Absolute Time when This Timer Expires
</H3>
<P>
Absolute time in millies when this timer will expire
<PRE>
extern ms_t HTTimer_expiresAbsolute (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Relative Time this Timer is running
</H3>
<P>
Gived the relative time in millies that this timer was registered with. For
example, a relative timer set to expire in 20ms will return 20.
<PRE>
#define HTTimer_getTime(t)	HTTimer_expiresRelative(t)
extern ms_t HTTimer_expiresRelative (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Has this Timer Expired?
</H3>
<P>
If so then it's time to call the dispatcher!
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTimer_hasTimerExpired (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  What callback is this Timer Registered with?
</H3>
<PRE>
extern HTTimerCallback * HTTimer_callback (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Is this Time relative or Absolute?
</H3>
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTTimer_isRelative (HTTimer * timer);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Platform Specific Timers
</H2>
<P>
On some platform, timers are supported via events or other OS specific
mechanisms. You can make libwww can support these by registering a platform
specific timer add and timer delete method.
<PRE>
typedef BOOL HTTimerSetCallback (HTTimer * timer);

extern BOOL HTTimer_registerSetTimerCallback (HTTimerSetCallback * cbf);
extern BOOL HTTimer_registerDeleteTimerCallback (HTTimerSetCallback * cbf);
