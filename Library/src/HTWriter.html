This version of the stream object just writes to a socket. The socket
is assumed open and closed afterward.There are two versions (identical
on ASCII machines) one of which converts to ASCII on output. We have
to have the Net Manager involved as we want to have control of how
many sockets we are using simultanously. This means that applications
should use the <A HREF="HTFWrite.html">ANSI C FILE writer stream</A>
for writing to an output. Proxy servers will have to go through the
Net Manager anyway, so this will not be a problem for them.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTWriter.c">HTWriter.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>
