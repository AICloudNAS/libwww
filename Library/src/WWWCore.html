</PRE>

This is the basic include file for the core of the W3C Reference
Library. Togrther with the <A HREF="WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil module</A>
it contains all core specific modules which are required to compile
and build the Library. No converter streams or protocol modules are
included in this file as they are for the application to set up. The
Library has a special include file called <A
HREF="WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> which contains all converters and
protocol modules known to the Library. You can include this one if the
application is to use all the functionality of the Library.

There are a few modules that are required by the Library but contains
application specific code. Depending on the application it may want to
override these modules with its own versions providing the same
interface to the Library.
