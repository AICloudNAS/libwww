A buffered output stream. This stream lets you write characters to a
stream without causing a write every time. The data is first written
into a buffer. Data is written to the actual stream only when the
buffer is full, or when the stream is flushed.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTBufWrt.c">HTBufWrt.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>.

<H2>Default Output Buffering</H2>

In order to optimize reading a channel, we bind a buffer to each
channel object. The size of this buffer is a compromise between speed
and memory. By default, we have chosen a value frequently used in TCP
connections. In the stream creation method you can pass any other
buffer size. In the case of 0, we take the default size.
