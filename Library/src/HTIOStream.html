<H1>I/O Stream Class Definition</H1>

</PRE>

A stream object is something which accepts a stream of text. Generally
streams are cascaded into stream pipes where the output of a stream is
directed into the input of the down stream object. The input and
output streams differs from other streams in that they are used to
communicate directly with a <A HREF="HTTrans.html">transport</A>.<P>

This module is a part of the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C Reference
Library</A>. <P>

All methods in the stream definition return an integer. The general
return codes from the methods are:

<UL>
<LI><B>HT_WOULD_BLOCK</B>
<LI><B>HT_ERROR</B>
<LI><B>HT_OK</B>

<LI><B>&gt;0</B> - any return greater than 0 will result in that the
return code will be parsed on from the <A
HREF="HTTrans.html">Transport read routine</A>. This can be used by
inidividual stream to introduce their own return codes.

</UL>

As streams now have a return value, it is <B>very</B> important that
these return values are passed upstream to all the other streams in
the stream pipe. <P>

<H2>Input Stream</H2>

An input stream is a stream that can read data from a transport and
via a channel putting the data down to the application.

<PRE>

typedef struct _HTInputStreamClass {

    char * name;
</PRE>

This field is for diagnostics only

<PRE>
    int (*flush)	(HTInputStream * me);
</PRE>

The <CODE>flush</CODE> method is introduced in order to allow the
stream to put any buffered data down the stream pipe but without
taking the stream pipe down. It is for the stream to decide whether it
has buffered data or not. In some situations, the stream might not
want to send buffered data down the target as the date might be
relevant for this stream only.

<PRE>
    int (*_free)	(HTInputStream * me);
</PRE>

The <CODE>free</CODE> method is like the <CODE>flush</CODE> method but
it also frees the current stream object and all stream objects down
stream. When the <CODE>free</CODE> method has been called, the
<EM>whole</EM> stream pipe (not only this object) should not accept
any more data. See also the <CODE>close</CODE> method below

<PRE>
    int (*abort)	(HTInputStream * me, HTList * errorlist);
</PRE>

The <CODE>abort</CODE> method should only be used if a stream is
interrupted, for example by the user, or an error occurs.

<PRE>
    int (*read)		(HTInputStream * me);
</PRE>

The <CODE>read</CODE> method is the method by which we can read data
from the <A HREF="HTTrans.html">transport layer</A>.

<PRE>
    int (*close)	(HTInputStream * me);
</PRE>

The <CODE>close</CODE> method closes the transport and deletes the
input stream object. Note that this is different than the free method
which doesn't have to delete the input stream object itself.

<PRE>
} HTInputStreamClass;
</PRE>

<H2>Output Stream</H2>

The output stream is similar to the <A HREF="HTStream.html">generic
stream definition</A> in that it has a superset of methods. The
<CODE>param</CODE> parameter and the <CODE>mode</CODE> parameter can
be used for whatever purpose suited.

<PRE>
typedef struct _HTOutputStreamClass {

    char * name;

    int (*flush)	(HTOutputStream * me);

    int (*_free)	(HTOutputStream * me);

    int (*abort)	(HTOutputStream * me, HTList * errorlist);

    int (*put_character)(HTOutputStream * me, char ch);

    int (*put_string)	(HTOutputStream * me, const char * str);

    int (*put_block)	(HTOutputStream * me, const char * str, int len);
</PRE>

See the <A HREF="HTStream.html">Generic Stream Definition</A> for an
explanation of these methods. Note that they all have a
<CODE>HTOutputStream</CODE> object a the parameter, not a generic
stream. This is to avoid <EM>incompatible pointer</EM> warnings

<PRE>
    int (*close)	(HTOutputStream * me);
</PRE>

The <CODE>close</CODE> method closes the transport and deletes the
input stream object. Note that this is different than the free method
which doesn't have to delete the input stream object itself.

<PRE>
} HTOutputStreamClass;
</PRE>

<H2>Transport Streams</H2>

Transport streams are special streams with creation methods like
defined below. Transport streams can be registered in the <A
HREF="HTTrans.html">HTTransport module</A> as ways of communicating
with the a transport.

<H3>Transport Input Stream</H3>

We have two modes of the input stream depending on model used for data
reading is <B>PUSH</B> or <B>PULL</B>. The PUSH model is suitable if
we are using pseudo threads based on a <CODE>select()</CODE> call or
equivalent and the <B>PULL</B> is suitable in a real thread
environment. In the latter case it doesn't matter if a read procedure
blocks as this only concerns a single thread.

<PRE>
typedef HTInputStream * HTInput_new	(HTNet *	net,
					 HTChannel *	ch,
					 HTStream *	target,
					 void *		param,
					 int		mode);
</PRE>

<H3>Transport Output Stream</H3>

<PRE>
typedef HTOutputStream * HTOutput_new	(HTNet *	net,
					 HTChannel *	ch,
					 void *		param,
					 int		mode);
