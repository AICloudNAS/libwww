<P>
As mentioned in the <A HREF="../User/Architecture/">Library Architecture</A>,
libwww consists of a small core and a large set of hooks for adding
functionality. By itself, the core it not capable of performing any Web related
tasks like accessing a HTTP server or parsing a HTML document. All this
functionality must be registered by the application. This way, the core of
libwww is kept application independent and can be used as the basic building
block for any kind of Web application. The Library comes with a large set
of default functions, for example for accessing HTTP and FTP servers, parsing
<A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc822.txt">RFC
822</A> headers etc. This module helps the application programmer setting
up all this functionality, but it is important to note that none of it is
<I>required</I> in order to use the Library.
<P>
This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTInit.c">HTInit.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">W3C Reference
Library</A>. You can also have a look at the other
<A HREF="WWWInit.html">Initialization modules</A>.

  Default Transport Protocol Modules
</H2>
<P>
Register the default set of transport protocols.
<PRE>
#include "WWWTrans.h"

extern void HTTransportInit (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Default Protocol Modules
</H2>
<P>
Set up default bindings between access schemes and the set of protocol modules
in the Library.

  <A NAME="MIME">Default MIME Parsers</A>
</H2>
<P>
The core doesn't have any built in MIME parsers, but many of the protocols
need them. For instance, many elements of the library rely on the
<CODE>Content-Length</CODE> being correctly set. HTMIMEInit provides the
minimal functionality needed for library reliablilty.

  Default Event Manager
</H2>
<P>
libwww core does not have any default event loop - it has to be added by
the application. However, it does come with an example implementation thta
may be used. This implementation is based on a <CODE>select</CODE> system
call using non-blocking and interleaved sockets.
<PRE>
#include "WWWApp.h"

extern void HTEventInit (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Converter">Default Media Type Conversions</A>
</H2>
<P>
The <EM>Converters</EM> are used to convert a media type to another media
type, or to present it on screen. This is a part of the stream stack algorithm.
The Presenters are also used in the stream stack, but are initialized separately.
<PRE>#include "WWWMIME.h"
#include "WWWHTML.h"
#include "WWWStream.h"
#include "WWWDir.h"
#include "WWWRules.h"

extern void HTConverterInit	(HTList * conversions);
</PRE>
<H3>
  Presenters
</H3>
<P>
The <EM>Presenters</EM> are used to present a media type to the use by calling
an external program, for example a post script viewer. This is a part of
the stream stack algorithm. The <I>Converters</I> are also used in the stream
stack, but are initialized separately. The <I>Presenters</I> use the same
include files as the <I>Converters</I>.
<PRE>
extern void HTPresenterInit	(HTList * conversions);

  Converters and Presenters
</H3>
<P>
This function is only defined in order to preserve backward compatibility.
<PRE>
extern void HTFormatInit	(HTList * conversions);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Default Content and Transfer Encodings
</H2>
<P>
Content encoders and decoders can handle encodings like <EM>chunked</EM>
etc.
<PRE>#include "WWWHTTP.h"

extern void HTEncoderInit	(HTList * encodings);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Default BEFORE and AFTER Net Callback Functions
</H2>
<P>
We register two often used callback functions: a <CODE>BEFORE</CODE> and
a <CODE>AFTER</CODE> callback Not done automaticly - may be done by application!
<PRE>#include "WWWApp.h"

extern void HTNetInit (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Default Message and Dialog Functions
</H2>
<P>
We register a set of alert messages Not done automaticly - may be done by
application!
<PRE>#include "WWWApp.h"

extern void HTAlertInit (void);
</PRE>
<H2>
  Default Icons for Directory Listings
</H2>
<P>
The WWWDir interface contains support for including references (URLs and
ALT text tags) to icons in directory listings. The icons are selected as
a function of the media type and the content encoding of the file in question.
That is - you can set up icons for compressed files, postscript files etc.
There is also a small set of specific icons representing directories etc.
<PRE>#include "<A HREF="WWWFile.html">WWWFile.h</A>"

extern void HTIconInit (const char * url_prefix);
