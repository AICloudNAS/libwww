<H1>Library Internals</H1>The <A
NAME=5 HREF="../../Architecture/../TheProject.html">WWW</A> browsers and servers share
a common architrecure, and a library
of common code. (See also: Browser<A
NAME=7 HREF="../../Architecture/BrowserOperation.html">
operation</A> , and<A
NAME=23 HREF="../../Architecture/UtilityOverview.html"> utility modules</A> which
are used throughout, and <A
NAME=z28 HREF="../Using.html">using the
common library</A> .).<P>
In the <A
NAME=1 HREF="../../Architecture/BrowserControl.ps">contol flow diagram</A> , common
code is to the right of the grey
line.
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=16>Application</A>
<DD> This module is the  main
program, and is window-system-dependent.
In the line mode browser , it is<A
NAME=21 HREF="../../Architecture/../LineMode/Implementation/HTBrowse.h">
HTBrowse</A> .  In the WWW server, it
is HTDaemon. The application is called
by the operating system, and manages
the overall running of the program.
It asks the <A
NAME=19 HREF="#8">navigation</A> module to
load the default page. 
<DT><A
NAME=8 HREF="HTAccess.html">Access Manager</A>
<DD> The module which acually
loads documents is based in HTAccess.c.
This uses all the <A
NAME=3 HREF="#2">protocol modules</A>
.  Given an anchor ID to jump to,
it asks the anchor object for the
address in order to load it.
<DT><A
NAME=20 HREF="HTHistory.html">History</A>
<DD> This module records and replays
on request the documents which the
user vists.
<DT><A
NAME=z29 HREF="HTFormat.html">Format manager</A>
<DD> The format manager
uses the <A
NAME=15 HREF="#11">parser modules</A> to load the
document as appropriate. It can also
decide on the format of a file from
its name.
<DT><A
NAME=9 HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor object</A>
<DD> The <A
NAME=22 HREF="../../Architecture/../Implementation/HTAnchor.h">HTAnchor</A> module
takes care of creating anchors, managing
the links between them and their
attributes. This module is independent
of the type of graphics object (text,
line drawing etc). It stores hypertext
addresses of anchors, and ensures
that anchors with the same address
are the same anchor. (<A
NAME=13 HREF="../../Architecture/Anchors.html"> More on anchors</A>
)
</DL>

<H2><A
NAME=2>Protocol modules</A></H2>A protocol module is invoked by the
navigation module in order to access
a document. Each protocol  module
is responible for extracting information
from a local file or remote server
using a particular protocol.  Depending
on the protocol, the protocol module
either builds a graphic object (e.g.
hypertext) itself, or it passes a
socket descriptor to the format manager
for parsing by one of the parser
modules. 
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=z46 HREF="HTFile.html">File access</A>
<DD> HTFile.c provides access
to files, using HTFTP.c for remote
access.  The latter uses HTTCP for
common TCP routines.
<DT><A
NAME=z45 HREF="HTTP.html">HTTP access</A>
<DD> The <A
NAME=25 HREF="../../Architecture/../Implementation/HTTP.h">HTTP module</A> handles
document search and retrieve using
the<A
NAME=6 HREF="../../Architecture/../Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html"> HTTP</A> protocol.
<DT><A
NAME=z40 HREF="HTNews.html">News access</A>
<DD> The NNTP internet news
protocol is handled by HTNews which
builds a hypertext.
<DT><A
NAME=z44 HREF="HTGopher.html">Gopher access</A>
<DD> The internet gopher
access to menus and flat files (and
links to telnet nodes etc) is handled
by <A
NAME=26 HREF="../../Architecture/../Implementation/HTGopher.h">HTGopher</A> .
<DT><A
NAME=z39 HREF="HTWAIS.html">WAIS access</A>
<DD> WAIS access is also implemented
in a separate<A
NAME=27 HREF="../../Architecture/../Daemon/WAISGate.html"> gateway program</A> .
</DL>

<H2><A
NAME=11>Format conversion modules</A></H2>These modules allow different formats
to be used to generate graphic objects.
They invoked by the <A
NAME=z30 HREF="HTFormat.html">format manager</A>
. Currently we only parse HTML and
plain text and MIME messages, but
obviously other formats can be added.<P>
See the format manager for the registration
and typing of conversion modules.
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=z31 HREF="HTML.html">HTML</A>
<DD> Basic hypertext parsing is done
by <A
NAME=18 HREF="../../Architecture/../Implementation/HTML.c">HTML.c</A> which uses the simple SGML
engine SGML.c as a basic tokeniser
and element stack manager.  This
uses:
<DT><A
NAME=z58 HREF="HTMLDTD.html">HTMLDTD</A>
<DD>The table defining some aspects
of the HTML document type description.
<DT><A
NAME=z52 HREF="HTPlain.html">Plain text to HTML</A>
<DD> Plain text can
can be converted.
</DL>

<H2><A
NAME=z37>Streams</A></H2>Streams are objects which accept
characters (and strings and blocks).
There is a basic <A
NAME=z35 HREF="HTStream.html">stream object</A> definition,
and many individual modules with
creation routines for different types
of stream.<P>
Streams can be thought of as like
files open for write.   Examples
of specific stream objects are:
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=z43 HREF="HTFWriter.html">HTWriter</A>
<DD> Writes to a socket or something
opend with open().
<DT><A
NAME=z42 HREF="HTFWriter.html">File writer</A>
<DD> Writes to a C  FILE *
object, as opened by fopen(), etc.
<DT><A
NAME=z41 HREF="SGML.html">SGML parser</A>
<DD> Parses a stream and generates
a structured stream.
<DT><A
NAME=z36 HREF="HTWSRC.html">WAIS source parser</A>
<DD> Parses a stream
with a WAIS source file on it, and
generates, via an HTML structured
stream, a stream of the required
type.
</DL>

<H2><A
NAME=z38>Structured streams</A></H2>A structured stream is like a <A
NAME=z32 HREF="HTStream.html">stream</A>
, but instead of just acepting text,
it also accepts SGML events such
as begina nd end elements. A structured
stream therefore represents a structured
document.   The elements and entites
are referred to by number, so each
structured stream must be created
with knowledge of the DTD which it
is currently using.<P>
The structured strams are definied
in the <A
NAME=z33 HREF="SGML.html">SGML module</A> .<P>
Any instance of a structured stream
has a related DTD which gives the
rules and element anbd entity names
for events on the structured stream.
The only DTD which is currently in
the library is the HTML DTD, in the<A
NAME=z34 HREF="HTMLDTD.html">
HTMLDTD</A> module.<P>
The SGML parser uses a DTD to ouput
to a structured stream from a stream
of SGML.  A hypertext editor will
output to a structured stream when
writing out a document.  Many <A
NAME=z56 HREF="#2">protocol
modules</A> output to a structures stream
when generating their data structures.<P>
Here are two structured stream modules:
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=z54 HREF="HTML.html">HTML</A>
<DD> This module is an important
one as it actually PRESENTS a hypertext
object to the user.  GUI writers
replcae this module with your own,
or use it and replaced the <A
NAME=z53 HREF="#12">HText</A>
module which it feeds.
<DT><A
NAME=z55 HREF="HTMLGen.html">HTMLGen</A>
<DD> This structured stream regenerates
a plain stream.  It makes reference
to the HTML DTD to regenerate the
names of enetities and elements.
This is used by the server to pass
a hypertext document on to the client,
and also by the client to save HTML.
</DL>

<H2><A
NAME=14>Graphic objects</A></H2>A graphic object is a (complex) displayable
entity. It is built by a protocol
module directly or using a parser.
Graphic objects are in general necessarily
coded differently on diferent window
systems. The graphic object is resposible
for displaying istelf, catching mouse
clicks, and calling the navigation
object in order to follow links.
We use the more common term "document"
to describe the logical entity which
a graphics object represents and
displays.
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=12 HREF="HText.html">HText</A>
<DD> This object is window-system
dependent. In the line mode browser,
the <A
NAME=17 HREF="../../Architecture/../LineMode/Internals.html#3">GridText</A> module is the hypertext
object, providing the generic functionality
of this module. 
</DL>

<H2>General modules</H2>
<DL>
<DT><A
NAME=z47 HREF="tcp.html">System specifics</A>
<DD> The tcp.h file includes
system-specific include files and
flags for I/O to network and disk.
<DT><A
NAME=z48 HREF="HTUtils.html">Utilities</A>
<DD> The HTUtil.h file includes
things we need everywhere, generally
macros for declarations, booleans,
etc.
<DT><A
NAME=z49 HREF="HTParse.html">URL parsing</A>
<DD> This module has various
utilities fo handling W3 addresses.
<DT><A
NAME=z50 HREF="HTChunk.html">Chunks</A>
<DD> Chunks are variable length
arrays, a sort of apology for real
strings in C.
<DT><A
NAME=z51 HREF="HTString.html">Strings</A>
<DD> A few manipulation routines
for strings of charcters.
