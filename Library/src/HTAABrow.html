<H1>Browser Side Access Authorization Module</H1>

This module is the browser side interface to Access Authorization (AA)
package.  It contains code only for browser.<P>

<B>Important</B> to know about memory allocation:<P>

Routines in this module use dynamic allocation, but free
automatically all the memory reserved by them.
<P>
Therefore the caller never has to (and never should)
<CODE>free()</CODE> any object returned by these functions.
<P>
Therefore also all the strings returned by this package
are only valid until the next call to the same function
is made. This approach is selected, because of the nature
of access authorization: no string returned by the package
needs to be valid longer than until the next call.
<P>
This also makes it easy to plug the AA package in:
you don't have to ponder whether to <CODE>free()</CODE>
something here or is it done somewhere else (because it
is always done somewhere else).
<P>
The strings that the package needs to store are copied
so the original strings given as parameters to AA
functions may be freed or modified with no side effects.
<P>
<B>Also note:</B>
The AA package does not <CODE>free()</CODE> anything else
than what it has itself allocated.
<P>

<H2>Routines for Browser Side Recording of AA Info</H2>

Most of the browser-side AA is done by the following two functions
(which are called from file <CODE>HTTP.c</CODE> so the browsers using
<CODE>libwww</CODE> only need to be linked with the new library and not
be changed at all):
<UL>

<LI><CODE>HTAA_composeAuth()</CODE> composes the
<CODE>Authorization:</CODE> line contents, if the AA package thinks
that the given document is protected. Otherwise this function returns
NULL.  This function also calls the functions <CODE>HTPrompt(),</CODE>
<CODE>HTPromptPassword()</CODE> and <CODE>HTConfirm()</CODE> to get
the username, password and some confirmation from the user.

<LI><CODE>HTAA_shouldRetryWithAuth()</CODE> determines whether to
retry the request with AA or with a new AA (in case username or
password was misspelled).

<H2>Enabling Gateway httpds to Forward Authorization</H2>
These functions should only be called from daemon code, and
<CODE>HTAAForwardAuth_reset()</CODE> must be called before the next
request is handled to make sure that authorization string
isn't cached in daemon so that other people can access private
files using somebody elses previous authorization information.
