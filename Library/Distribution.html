  Getting the Libwww Source
</H1>
<P>
W3C freely distributes everything connected with libwww including
<A HREF="src/">source code</A>, <A HREF="User/">documentation</A>,
<A HREF="User/Applications.html">example applications</A>, and provide free
access to the <A HREF="cvs.html">CVS repository</A>.&nbsp;Libwww is covered
by the <A HREF="../Consortium/Legal/copyright-software.html">W3C Copyright
Statement</A>, and with <A HREF="../CERN.html">acknowledgment to CERN</A>.
We <B>only</B> release the distribution as source code - you must compile
it yourself.
<H2>
  Checkout from CVS (Preferred)
</H2>
<P>
Using <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">CVS</A> allows you to
follow the development of libwww closely and to contribute much easier. Also,
you will get a lot of bug fixes that are not in the distribution tar ball.
In fact, if you intend to provide patches then you <B>should</B> use the
CVS repository! Please <B><A HREF="cvs.html">read the instructions</A></B>
for how to checkout libwww from
<A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">CVS</A>.
<P>
If you intend to write code for libwww then have a look at the
<A HREF="User/Style/">coding guide lines</A> before you begin.
<H2>
  <A NAME="Snapshot">Download a CVS Snapshot</A>
</H2>
<P>
For those who wish to keep up with the source development but do not have
direct access to our CVS repository due to firewalls etc., we generate a
snapshot tarball of the repository on a daily basis. You can copy this to
your system, unpack it, and treat it as your working copy or alternatively
you can use the <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">CVS import
facility</A> into your own CVS repository.
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="ftp://dev.w3.org/pub/libwww/cvs-snapshot.tar.gz">Get the latest
    CVS snapshot as a gzipped tar file</A> - it is generated daily around <B>3.30
    AM ET</B>
</UL>
<P>
We don't promise anything but there is a good chance that it compiles as
long as you <A HREF="cvs.html#Boot">follow the same instructions</A> as if
you did a normal CVS checkout.
<H2>
  Contributions
</H2>
<P>
The best thing is if we can incorporate contributions from you into the libwww
code base but until this is done, you can have a look at the current set
of <A HREF="contrib/">contributions with new cool features</A>.
<H2>
  Downloading a Release Tar Ball
</H2>
<P>
Download the <A HREF="cvs.html#Releases">latest release distribution
package</A> in one of the following formats:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="w3c-libwww.tar.gz">gzipped tar file</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="w3c-libwww.tar.Z">compressed tar file</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="w3c-libwww.zip">zip file</A>
</UL>
<P>
You can find <A HREF="Distribution/">old versions</A> of the software in
the <A HREF="Distribution/">distribution archives</A>. When you have downloaded
libwww, you are ready to <A HREF="../README.html">unpack and compile</A>
the software, and you can find more information on how the Library is designed
in the <A HREF="User/Architecture/">Library Architecture</A> and how to use
it in the <A HREF="User/Using/">User's Guide</A>.
