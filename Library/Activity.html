  W3C Reference Library Position Statement
</H1>
<P>
The W3C Reference Library provides a basic, application independent API for
building Web applications. The purpose of the Library is to demonstrate a
Web API in practice, show new features, act as a reference implementation
for W3C specifications and make it easy to build new Web applications. This
is the W3C position statement of direction concerning <A HREF="./">W3C Reference
Library</A> and it is part of the
<A HREF="../Consortium/Prospectus/ActivityList">W3C position statements</A>.
<H2>
  Background
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="./">W3C Reference Library</A>, a.k.a. libwww has been part of
the World Wide Web almost from the beginning. Tim Berners-Lee designed and
implemented the first version back in November 1992 in order to demonstrate
the Web model. Many people have picked up the Library and used it in a variety
of contexts. Applications such as Lou Montulli's Lynx character based client,
Mosaic Web browser by Marc Andreesen and Eric Bena, and the CERN server by
Ari Luotonen were all based on later versions of libwww. Later on, applications
like the Arena browser by Dave Raggett and H&aring;kon W. have been added
to the list.
<H2>
  Current Status
</H2>
<P>
Version 4.0 of the <A HREF="../../">W3C Reference Library</A>, a.k.a. libwww,
was released to the public in January. Our expectations were high as the
Library had undertaken a major revision of its APIs and it was the first
version that supported both the Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh platforms.
However, from the number of people who downloaded the Library, it was considered
a success. In the period from January 12 to February 12, version 4.0 was
downloaded almost 6000 times from our FTP server.
<P>
We maintain a number of small example applications in order to guarantee
diversity in the libwww architecture and to show how to use libwww and how
to build applications on top of it.

    Mode Browser</B>
  <DD>
    The Line Mode Browser is a character-based Web browser developed for use
    on terminals. It is an example of a client application using the
    <A HREF="./">libwww</A>. It is also useful as a test tool for quick access
    to the Web from scripts, cron jobs etc.

  Accomplishments
</H2>
<P>
The libwww API was presented at the
"<A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~eliens/WWW5/program.html">Programming the
Web - a search for APIs</A>" workshop in connection with the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/Conferences/WWW5/">5th World Wide Web
conference</A> in Paris. The
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/Conferences/WWW5/">libwww position paper</A>
presented at the workshop discusses &nbsp;the basic requirements of a generic
Web API and the lessons learned from the development of the libwww API. The
most important requirement that we see today is that the Web must move towards
<I>language independent, formalized APIs.</I> Only by doing this can we ensure
that the APIs can keep up with the Web explosion which does not show signs
of slowing down. W3C sees the development of generic and open Web APIs as
an essential part of building new generations of Web applications and takes
an active role in focusing efforts towards this goal.
<H2>
  Next Step
</H2>
<P>
Libwww is still in use by many applications and lately our own Amaya Web
client has been added to the list. Many new and exiting features have been
added and we are now ready to present the first beta release of version 4.1
- scheduled for final release June 15.
<P>
We are actively looking into how the experiences from building the libwww
API fits into the paradigm of <A HREF="../MobileCode/">mobile code</A> being
an important part of the Web model. Especially, we are looking to integration
between libwww and
<A HREF="ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">ILU</A> and also
how we can integrate libwww with other languages such as Tcl and Java.
<P>
