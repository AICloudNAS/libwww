  W3C Reference Library Activities
</H1>
<P>
The W3C Reference Library provides a basic, application independent API for
building Web applications. The purpose of the Library is to demonstrate a
Web API in practice, show new features, act as a reference implementation
for W3C specifications and make it easy to build new Web applications. This
is the W3C statement of direction concerning <A HREF="./">W3C Reference
Library</A> and it is part of the
<A HREF="../Consortium/Prospectus/ActivityList">W3C activity list</A>.
<H2>
  Background
</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="./">W3C Reference Library</A>, a.k.a. libwww has been part of
the World Wide Web almost from the beginning. Tim Berners-Lee designed and
implemented the first version back in November 1992 in order to demonstrate
the Web model. Many people have picked up the Library and used it in a variety
of contexts. Applications such as Lou Montulli's Lynx character based client,
Mosaic Web browser by Marc Andreesen and Eric Bena, and the CERN server by
Ari Luotonen were all based on later versions of libwww. Later on, applications
like the Arena browser by Dave Raggett and H&aring;kon W. have been added
to the list.
<H2>
  Current Status
</H2>
<P>
The Library was first developed on Unix machines but the user profile of
the Web has changed dramatically since then. One of the main goals of the
4.0 version was to integrate libwww with MS Windows and the Mac environments
in order to provide a freely available set of Web APIs for building applications
on MS Windows and Macintosh machines as well as Unix.
<P>
The second main goal was to stabilize the APIs so that people could rely
on the same features being there from version to version. This goal was also
fulfilled as libwww is now a highly modular package consisting of a small
core to which the application provider can hook exactly the functionality
needed for a particular application.
<H2>
  Accomplishments
</H2>
<P>
W3C member organizations can obtain a copy of each alpha, beta, and public
distribution of the reference code (this latter with a one month lead time
over public release) at no charge. The frequency with which new distributions
is twice per year. Libwww version 4.1 was released December 1st to W3C members
and became publicly available January 1st 1996. It has since then been downloaded
more than xxx times since then and are actively being used in commercial
Web products.
<P>
The first beta version of Library version 4.1 has been released May 24 to
W3C members and will be officially released Mid June 1996.
<H2>
  Example Applications
</H2>
<P>
We maintain a number of small example applications in order to guarantee
diversity in the libwww architecture and to show how to use libwww and how
to build applications on top of it.

    <A HREF="../LineMode/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/LMB48x" ALT="LMB"></A> <B>Line
    Mode Browser</B>
  <DD>
    The Line Mode Browser is a character-based Web browser developed for use
    on terminals. It is an example of a client application using the
    <A HREF="./">libwww</A>. It is also useful as a test tool for quick access
    to the Web from scripts, cron jobs etc.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../ComLine/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/lines48x" ALT="ComLine"></A>
    <B>Command Line Tool</B>
  <DD>
    This application which shows how to use the W3C Reference Library for building
    simple batch mode tools for accessing the Web.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../Robot/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/robot48x" ALT="Robot"></A> <B>Mini
    Robot</B>
  <DD>
    A simple application which shows how to use the W3C Reference Library for
    building robots
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../MiniServ/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/serv48x" ALT="MiniServ"></A>
    <B>Mini Server</B>
  <DD>
    A small example application showing how to implement a server or a proxy
    using the W3C Reference Library.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../Listen/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/listen48x" ALT="Listen"></A>
    <B>Listen</B>
  <DD>
    A small tool that can listen on a socket. Good for debugging clients.

<H2>
  Next Step
</H2>
<P>
We are actively looking into how the experiences from building the libwww
API fits into the paradigm of <A HREF="../MobileCode/">mobile code</A> being
an important part of the Web model. Especially, we are looking to integration
between libwww and
<A HREF="ftp://parcftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">ILU</A> and also
how we can integrate libwww with other languages such as Tcl and Java.
