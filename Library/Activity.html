<H1>Library: Activity</H1>

This is the W3C statement of direction concerning <A HREF="./">Reference Code</A>. It is part of the
<A HREF="../Consortium/Prospectus/ActivityList">W3C activity list</A>. <P>

The <A HREF="./">W3C Reference Library</A>, a.k.a. libwww has been part of the World-Wide Web almost
from the beginning. Tim Berners-Lee designed and implemented the first version back in November 1992
in order to demonstrate the Web model. The purpose of the Library has always been to demonstrate new
features and to make it easy to build new Web applications and to spread the Web. <P>

Many people have picked up the Library and used it in a variety of contexts. Applications such as
Lou Montulli's Lynx character based client, Mosaic Web browser by Marc Andreesen and Eric Bena, and
the CERN server by Ari Luotonen were all based on later versions of libwww. Later on, applications
like the Arena browser by Dave Raggett and H&aring;kon W. have been added to the list. <P>

I started working on libwww as part of my Master's Project at <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</A>
in February 1994 just when Mosaic started to be known by a fast growing community. In February 1996,
exactly 2 years later, version 4.0 was released. Much has changed since the first version: The
libwww has found a new home at <A HREF="../">W3C</A> and the functionality has evolved, but the
spirit is still the same - the purpose of libwww is to provide an easy interface for writing Web
applications so that the Web community can explore the potential of the Web and the Internet. <P>

<H2>Status of libwww version 4.0</H2>

The Library was first developed on Unix machines but the user profile of the Web has changed
dramatically since then. One of the main goals for the 4.0 version was to integrate libwww with MS
Windows and the Mac environments in order to provide a freely available set of Web APIs for building
applications on MS Windows and Macintosh machines as well as Unix.<P>

The second main goal was to stabilize the APIs so that people could rely on the same features being
there from version to version. This goal was also fulfilled as libwww is now a highly modular package
consisting of a small core to which the application provider can hook exactly the functionality
needed for a particular application. <P>

On the other hand, the documentation is still less than ideal. Though it has shown recent
improvement, it is still far from the standards known from many popular software packages, for
example the X library. I truly believe that this is one of the main obstacles that prevents many
people from getting started using libwww for building Web applications. That is a shame as the
interest is there - in the period from January 12 to February 12, Version 4.0 of the Library was
down loaded from our FTP server more than 5000 times. Also, the discussions on the <A
HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib/">libwww mailing list</A> show that people are in
fact using it but find it difficult to extract many of the details.

<H3>Current Documentation</H3>

All of the <A HREF="User/">current documentation</A> is written as HTML pages, as hypertext provides
a good way of integrating the <A HREF="src/">C based source code</A> itself into the
documentation. As an example, all the include files are generated from HTML so that the
documentation automatically is kept up to date.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="User/Architecture/"><IMG ALT="Architecture"
SRC="../Icons/WWW/design48x.gif"></A> <B>Library Architecture</B>

<DD>This document describes the architecture of the Library in generic terms without referring
directly to the code itself. It is meant to give an overview of the design which is required if you
intend to enhance the Library.

<DT><A HREF="User/Using/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/guide48x.gif"
ALT="Using"></A> <B>User's Guide</B>

<DD>This guide describes the "user's view" of the W3C Reference Library. It concentrates on
describing the API and how the application programmer can use the Library. It also describes who is
responsible for memory management, how to initialize modules, etc. Reading this guide should be
sufficient in order to use the Library without being aware of exactly what is going on underneath
the interface.

<DT><A HREF="Guide/"><IMG ALT="Internals"
SRC="../Icons/WWW/internals48x.gif"></A> <B>Internals</B>

<DD>This is the overall set of interfaces in the W3C Reference Library. An interface can cover
multiple related C modules and it is defined by a <B>WWW*.h</B> include file, for example <A
HREF="src/WWWCore.html">WWWCore.h</A>. On <A
HREF="User/Platform/WinDLL.html">Windows platforms</A>, each interface corresponds
to a DLL with a DLL definition file defining all exported methods and data objects.
</DL>

<H3>Example Applications</H3>

We have a small set of example applications to show how to use libwww and how to
build applications on top of it.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="Examples/">A set of really simple examples</A>
<DD>The very basics for starting libwww and loading a URL etc.

<DT><A HREF="../LineMode/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/LMB48x.gif" ALT="LMB"></A> <B>Line
Mode Browser</B>

<DD>The Line Mode Browser is a character-based Web browser developed for use on terminals. It is an
example of a client application using the <A HREF="./">libwww</A>. It is also useful as a test tool
for quick access to the Web from scripts, cron jobs etc.

<DT><A HREF="../ComLine/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/lines48x.gif" ALT="ComLine"></A>
<B>Command Line Tool</B>

<DD>This application which shows how to use the W3C Reference Library for building simple batch mode
tools for accessing the Web.

<DT><A HREF="../Robot/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/robot48x.gif" ALT="Robot"></A> <B>Mini Robot</B>
<DD>A simple application which shows how to use the W3C Reference Library for building robots

<DT><A HREF="../MiniServ/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/serv48x.gif" ALT="MiniServ"></A> <B>Mini Server</B>
<DD>A small example application showing how to implement a server or a proxy using the W3C
Reference Library.

<DT><A HREF="../Listen/"><IMG SRC="../Icons/WWW/listen48x.gif" ALT="Listen"></A> <B>Listen</B>
<DD>A small tool that can listen on a socket. Good for debugging clients.

</DL>

<H2>Plans for Version 4.1</H2>

The next version of the Library and the example application will be release by <B>June 1996</B> as
part of the biaanual releases that W3C are commited to do. As a general rule we try to put as much
new featues in as possible and therefore the following list is to be considered a subset :-)

<DL>

<DT>Autoconf
<DD>The next version will support autoconf

<DT>Memory Resource Handler
<DD>The Library needs a mechanism to allow to get around situations when memory is exhausted.

<DT>Better debug and trace messages facilities
<DD>Currently all debug messages are included in all versions of the Library. In order to
distinguish between debug versions and release versions, the debug messages should only be included
in the debug version.

<DT>Experimenting with HTTP protocol implementations including HTTP/1.x, PEP and <A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP-NG/">HTTP-NG</A>
<DD>An important part of the W3C software is to provide reference implementations of the Web
protocols. The next release will provide important new features in this area.

<DT>Integration with <A HREF="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">ILU</A> from Xerox Parc
<DD>Integrating ILU and libwww is part of the experiments with HTTP-NG and it also allows for better
integration between various programming languages.
