  Writing directly to the <A HREF="cvs.html">CVS repository</A> is reserved
  for <A HREF="#Collaborators"><EM>libwww hackers</EM></A> who have intimate
  knowledge of the code base and have proven their ability to use this privilege
  to the benefit of the libwww user community. You are of course more than
  welcome (read strongly encouraged) to submit patches to the
  &lt;<A HREF="./#Forums">www-lib@w3.org</A>&gt; mailing list regardless of
  whether you have write access or not. If the patch is good, chances are good
  that it will be added to the CVS codebase by one of the libwww hackers.

We don't have a formal mechanism but the idea is that you have to prove your
hacking ability. The best way to is to start contributing patches based on
the <A HREF="cvs.html">latest code base</A> and to be active on the
&lt;<A HREF="./#Forums">www-lib@w3.org</A>&gt; mailing list. Make sure that
you have read the <A HREF="User/Style/">libwww style guide</A> before you
start.

  <A NAME="Help">How can I help?</A>
</H2>
<P>
We have a <A HREF="User/ToDo.html">very interesting set of things to do</A>
- your help is required to make timely progress. Remember that only the sky
is the limit - cool ideas are always welcome! Pick a project and don't forget
to send mails to &lt;<A HREF="./#Forums">www-lib@w3.org</A>&gt; about what
you are up to or to ask questions!
