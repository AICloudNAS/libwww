  Writing directly to the <A HREF="cvs.html">CVS repository</A> is reserved
  for <B>libwww collaborators</B> who have intimate knowledge of the code base
  and have proven their ability to use this privilege to the benefit of the
  libwww user community. You are of course more than welcome (read strongly
  encouraged) to submit patches to the
  &lt;<A HREF="./#Forums">www-lib@w3.org</A>&gt; mailing list regardless of
  whether you have write access or not. If the patch is good, chances are good
  that it will be added to the CVS codebase by one of the collaborators.

<P>
We don't have a formal mechanism but the idea is that you have to prove your
hacking ability. The best way to is to start contributing patches based on
the <A HREF="cvs.html">latest code base</A> and to be active on the
&lt;<A HREF="./#Forums">www-lib@w3.org</A>&gt; mailing list. Make sure that
you have read the <A HREF="User/Style/">libwww style guide</A> before you
start.

We have a very interesting set of things to do - <STRONG>your help is required
to make timely progress</STRONG>!

    <A HREF="../Protocols/">HTTP Digest Authentication</A> - <STRONG>in progress
    by Jose Kahan</STRONG>
  <DD>
    Is becoming more and more important the and set of features is extremely
    interesting. Libwww supports easy addition of
    <A HREF="src/HTAAUtil.html">multiple authentication schemes</A> - there are
    already some initial digest stuff.
  <DT>
    Regular expressions in URI mapping rules
  <DD>
    Libwww already supports URI mappings in the rules module but support for
    sed like regular expressions would be extremely useful, especially for mirroring
    done by the <A HREF="../Robot/">Webbot</A>. Libwww already uses
    <A HREF="src/HTProxy.html">regular expressions for handling proxies</A> and
    other things.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html#robotstxt">Robot
    txt file parser</A> - <STRONG>done by John Punin!</STRONG>
  <DD>
    The <A HREF="../Robot/">Webbot</A> already knows about the
    <A HREF="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html#meta">robot
    META tags</A> - help turning it into a well-behaving robot by understanding
    <A HREF="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/exclusion.html#robotstxt">robot.txt
    files</A> as well.
  <DT>
    Drag-and-drop &nbsp;support in <A HREF="../WinCom/">Web Commander</A>
  <DD>
    Would be cool to have as well as integration with the Explorer menu. It would
    make it a lot easier to work with
  <DT>
    Provide an install shield for the <A HREF="../WinCom/">Web Commander</A>
  <DD>
    The Web Commander could really use an in install shield to get Windows people
    up and going. It would be very nice if it could also support installing the
    <A HREF="User/Guide/">libwww DLLs</A> in a suitable location.
  <DT>
    Provide better Windows Makefiles
  <DD>
    I&nbsp;am waiting (Setember 20, 1998) for autoconf and automake to be released
    with support for Windows as I am happy about the way this works on Unix.
    Any better ideas plan for improving Windows makefiles?
  <DT>
    Implementing the <A HREF="../Protocols/HTTP/ietf-http-ext/">HTTP Extension
    Framework</A>
  <DD>
    We have many exiting HTTP extensions waiting for the
    <A HREF="../Protocols/HTTP/ietf-http-ext/">HTTP Extension Framework</A>.
    Your help is needed! The implementation can be based on the
    <A HREF="src/HTPEP.html">PEP implementation</A>.

<P>
Don't forget to send mails to
&lt;<A HREF="./#Forums">www-lib@w3.org</A>&gt; about what you are up to or
to ask questions!
