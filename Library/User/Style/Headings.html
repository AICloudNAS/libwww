<H1>Function Headings</H1>

This style concerns the comments, and so is not essential to compilation.
However, it helps readability of code written by a number of people.
Some of these conventions may be arbitrary, but are none the less
useful for that. 

<H2>Format</H2>

A typical example of a function header looks like:

<PRE>
/*	Scan a line
**	-----------
**	This function scannes a string for ...
**
** On entry,
**	l		points to the zero-terminated line to be scanned
** On exit,
**	*l		The line has null termintors inserted after each
**			 word found.
**	return value	is the number of words found, or -1 if error.
**	lines		This global value is incremented.
*/	
PRIVATE int scan_line (CONST char * line)
{
   /* Code here */
}
</PRE>

<DL>

<DT>Separation of functions
<DD>White space of two lines separating functions

<DT>Name of the function 
<DD>The identifier of the function right-justified to make it easy to
find when flicking through a listing

<DT>Function header
<DD>The macros <CODE>PUBLIC</CODE> and <CODE>PRIVATE</CODE> (in <A
HREF="../../Library/Implementation/HTUtils.html">HTUtils.h</A>) expand to
<CODE>NULL</CODE> and to <CODE>static</CODE> respectively. They show
that one has thought about whether visibility is required outside the
module, and they get over the overloading of the keyword "static" in
C. Use one or the other. (Use for top level variables too).

<DT>Entry and exit conditions 

<DD>It is most important to document the function as seen by the rest
of the world (especially the caller). The most important aspects of
the appearance of the function to the caller are the pre- and
post-conditions. The preconditions include the value of the parameters
and structures they point to. Both include any requirements on or
changes to global data, the screen, disk files, etc.
