  Modules
</H1>
<P>
A module consists normally of the following:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A module definition file, for example <EM>foo.c</EM>
  <LI>
    A module declaration file, for example <EM>foo.h</EM>
  <LI>
    A module description file, for example <EM>foo.html</EM>
</UL>
<P>
Even though ANSI C doesn't support classes or objects, it is an advantage
- especially when more and more people are going to contribute with modules
that each module is a self-contained unit with a clearly defined interface
to the rest of the world. It is important that you supply a lot of "methods"
for accessing the data structures and only declare as little
<CODE>PUBLIC</CODE> as possible of the internal structures.
<P>
Make sure that your file names are not <B>longer than 8 characters</B> as
we support PCs as well. The declaration file is <B>automatically</B> generated
from the description file. This ensures that the description of a module
is done at the same time as the declaration of the module. The generation
of the declaration files is done at compile time using the
<A HREF="../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>, so be sure that you have
a recent version of this.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../Icons/32x32/caution" ALT="NOTE"> It is <EM>very</EM> important
that all modifications to the modules declaration part is done in the description
file as this is what we keep in CVS - NOT the declaration file itself!
<P>
The module header is the comment at the top of a definition file and description
file. Remember - as other people are going to read this then fill it out
carefully.
