  House Style for C Programming
</H1>
<P>
The W3C reference Library (a.k.a. libww) is written with a certain house
style that almost certainly differs from what you are used to. However, we
have our reasons for doing this - well not all of it but most of it! Anyway,
the purpose of all W3C code is to be:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    highly portable so that it works on any thinkable
    <A HREF="../../Library/User/Platform/">platform</A>
  <LI>
    consistent in style so that it is easy to read by other project members
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../Icons/32x32/warning"> Remember, that even it might seem
impossible when you are writing the code - <EM>somebody will some day have
to change it!</EM> Therefore, it is very important that we all follow the
house style! However, the house style is not cast in stone so if you have
good suggestions, do send them - but they really have to be good ;-)
<P>
<B>IF YOU DO NOT ABIDE BY THIS GUIDE YOUR CODE WILL ANNOY OTHER TEAM MEMBERS
AND MAY NOT PORT.</B>
<P>
First of all, please take a look at the <A HREF="../../Library/src/">existing
W3C source code</A> and see what it look like, then some of the things below
might make more sense. The style guide is divided into sections on
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="Language.html">Language 'features'</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="ModuleHeader.html">Modules</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="Macros.html">Macros</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="Identifiers.html">Identifiers</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="IncludeFiles.html">Include files</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="Headings.html">Function header</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="Body.html">Function Body Layout</A>
</UL>
<P>
All our code is kept in the CVS code management system, so if you are not
familiar with this then please read the <A HREF="../UseOfCVS.html">online
manual</A>.
