<H1>House Style for C Programming</H1>

The W3C software modules are all written with a certain house style
that almost certainly differs from what you are used to. However, we
have our reasons for doing this - well not all of it but most of it!
Anyway, the purpose of all W3C code is to be:

<UL>

<LI>highly portable so that it works on any thinkable <A
HREF="../Library/User/Platform/">platform</A>

<LI>consistent in style so that it is easy to read by other project
members

</UL>

<IMG SRC="../Icons/32x32/warning.gif"> Remember, that even it might
seem impossible when you are writing the code - <EM>somebody will some
day have to change it!</EM> Therefore, it is very important that we
all follow the house style! However, the house style is not cast in
stone so if you have good suggestions, do send them - but they really
have to be good ;-) <P>

<B>IF YOU DO NOT ABIDE BY THIS GUIDE YOUR CODE WILL ANNOY OTHER TEAM
MEMBERS AND MAY NOT PORT.</B><P>

First of all, please take a look at the <A
HREF="../README.html">existing W3C source code</A> and see what it
look like, then some of the things below might make more sense. You
will find this <A HREF="../README.html#dirstruc">Directory
structure</A> under <CODE>/afs/w3.org/hypertext/</CODE>. The style
guide is divided into sections on

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Modules.html">Modules in straight ANSI C</A>
<LI><A HREF="Language.html">Language 'features'</A> <P>

<LI><A HREF="ModuleHeader.html">Modules</A>
<LI><A HREF="Macros.html">Macros</A>
<LI><A HREF="Identifiers.html">Identifiers</A>
<LI><A HREF="IncludeFiles.html">Include files</A>
<LI><A HREF="Headings.html">Function header</A>
<LI><A HREF="Body.html">Code style</A>
</UL>

All our code is kept in the CVS code management system, so if you are
not familiar with this then please read the <A
HREF="UseOfCVS.html">online manual</A>.
