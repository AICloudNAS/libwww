<H1>Include Files</H1>

There are three kinds of include files:

<UL>
<LI>Application include files
<LI>Library include files
<LI>System include files and standard C include files
</UL>

<H2>Application Include Files</H2>

The .c file should #include its own .h file. A .h file should be
protected so that no errors occur if it is #included twice. This can
be done by the following directives:

<PRE>
	#ifndef HTFOO_H
	#define HTFOO_H

	All the stuff

	#endif /* HTFOO_H */
</PRE>

An interface which relies on other interfaces should include those
interface files.  An implemention file which uses other modules should
include the .h file if it not already included by its own .h file. <P>

<IMG SRC="../Icons/32x32/warning.gif" ALT="WARNING"> The text format
in description files which are converted into declaration files
<EM>MUST NOT</EM> be more than 90 characters wide - otherwise it will
get chopped off by the <A HREF="../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>
the way the conversion is set up.

<H2>Library Include Files</H2>

If you are making a <A HREF="../Library/">Library of Common Code</A>
module then you need to include all the modules that you reference in
your code. You will in all cases need the following:

<PRE>
	#include "tcp.h"
	#include "HTUtils.h"
	#include "HTString.h"
</PRE>

If you are <B>not</B> making a Library module, then the only one you
need is <A HREF="../Library/Implementation/WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A>

<H2>System include files and standard C include files</H2>

As these are included in the Library code, you will normally not need
to (and should avoid) include any such files. The reason is that these
include files are very difficult to get portable over multiple
platforms.
