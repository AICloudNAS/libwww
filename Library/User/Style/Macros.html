<H1>Macros used in the W3C Code</H1>

These are macros which make it less tedious to program in portable
C. They are defined in <A
HREF="../../Library/Implementation/HTUtils.html">HTUtils.html</A>.

<H2><A NAME=10>CONST</A></H2>

This is used instead of the keyword "const" which causes on some
platforms

<H2>PRIVATE</H2>

It is used in a function or variable declaration to signify that the
function is private to the module, rather than public (the default).
Avoids the confusion in C between "static" used in this sense, and
used to declare storage variables within blocks as static as opposed
to automatic.

<H2><A NAME=z14>PUBLIC</A></H2>

It is used to signify that a function is part of the public
interface. As this macro is used in windows to generate DLLs it is
<EM>very</EM> important that you use it! It also is a good idea to use
simply because it ensures that the programmer has thought about it.
This prevents unnecessry accidental public definitions which may later
clash with other people's routines.
