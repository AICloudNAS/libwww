  Macros used in the W3C Code
</H1>
<P>
These are macros which make it less tedious to program in portable C. They
are defined in <A HREF="../../Library/src/HTUtils.html">HTUtils.html</A>.
<H2>
  <A NAME="PRIVATE">PRIVATE</A>
</H2>
<P>
It is used in a function or variable declaration to signify that the function
is private to the module, rather than public (the default). Avoids the confusion
in C between "static" used in this sense, and used to declare storage variables
within blocks as static as opposed to automatic.
<H2>
  <A NAME=z14>PUBLIC</A>
</H2>
<P>
It is used to signify that a function is part of the public interface. As
this macro is used in windows to generate DLLs it is <EM>very</EM> important
that you use it! It also is a good idea to use simply because it ensures
that the programmer has thought about it. This prevents unnecessry accidental
public definitions which may later clash with other people's routines.
