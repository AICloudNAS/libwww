<H1>How to get Started</H1>

This note explains how to get started if you are writing a World-Wide
Web application. For details on how to use the library, you should
look at the <A HREF="../User/Guide/">Internals and Programmer's
Guide</A>.

The <A HREF="../">Library of Common Code</A> is a general purpose tool
for exchanging information from the network using a wide set of the
most popular application layer protocol like HTTP, WAIS, FTP etc. The
library contains code for accessing, parsing, and managing data
objects from the network and it can be used as the basis for many
types of WWW applications including clients, servers, and proxy
servers. It is writen in C and is ported to a large number of
platforms using very basic programming utilities. <P>

When starting writing a WWW application, it is a good idea to look at
the reference applications which all are built on top of the Library:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../../Daemon/Status.html">World-Wide Web Server</A>
<LI><A HREF="../../Arena/">Arena Client</A>
<LI><A HREF="../../LineMode/">Line-Mode Browser</A>
</UL>

The <A HREF="../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> is the simplest
application which uses the library and it especially intended as an
example of how to use the library. <P>


For a <B>GUI client</B>, the basic task is to define the set of
methods for presenting a graphic object which can be a hypertext
document or any other type of data object. That is, the client must
define how to show the graphic object and how it can be manipulated
using the mouse etc. <P>

The library contains code for managing a graphic object in a text
based application as is the case with the Line Mode Browser, but
generally, a new platform has a new implementation of the hypertext
object. A GUI client must overwrite the graphic object modules in the
Library in order to take advantage of a more advanced
user-interface. The graphic object as defined in the Library has three
interfaces, depending on how much of the Library code the client wants
to handle on its own (on the figure, the more you are to the left, the
more you will have to write yourself).

<DL>

<DT>SGML Stream Interface

<DD>Use this intergace if you do not want to use the <A
HREF="../Implementation/SGML.html">SGML parser</A> in the Library and
the following transition to a structured stream which is a subclass of
the stream class. This can all be set up with out overwriting any
module but simply by defining the converters not to use the SGML/HTML
parsers.

<DT>HTML Structured Stream Interface

<DD>If the client has its own HTML parser then the interface is
between the client HTML parser and the Library SGML parser. The SGML
parser is a general SGML parser which can be setup with a specific DTD
and it feeds the HTML parser with structured data. In this case, you
will be emulating the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTML.c">HTML
module</A>, and generating a hypertext object from the structured
stream.

<DT>HText Call Back Interface

<DD>If the client wants to use the HTML parser in the Library then
this is the interface to use for the application. The hypertext object
is parsed and the communication with the client is based on a set of
call-back functions in the HTML parser. The call-back functions are
all defined as prototypes in the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HText.html">HText module</A> but the client
must provide the actual code that defines the presentation method used
for a specific HTML tag. If you wish to maintain the structure of the
SGML file within your object, then the SGML interface will be a better
place to connect your code.

</DL>

You are free to define the structure of the hypertext object (the
structure is left undefined in the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HText.html">HText module</A>. You may want to
define your own styles and font definitions. <P>

When the client wants to request a URI, then it can pass either the
URI or an <A HREF="../../Architecture/Anchors.html">Anchor object</A> to
the Library. Internally in the Library, all URIs are handled as anchor
objects, as URIs then can be compared to one another and stored in a
structure modeling the part of the Web, the user has visited. Using the
anchor structure, the Library is capable of 

<UL>

<LI>Building links between anchors so that they represent the part of
the web visited by the user

<LI>Following the link from a given anchor

<LI>Maintaining a history list for fast navigation
</UL>

The URI and the Graphic Obejct interface are the only two interfaces
the client must provide in order to request and present objects using
the World-Wide Web. Good Luck!
