<H1>Known Bugs in Library of Common Code</H1>

<HR>

The list of known bugs are in reverse chronological order.<P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/caution.gif"> If you (very unlikely) have
discovered a new <B>BUG</B> or just have a great idea - pronounced
patches ;-) then please mail <EM>libwww@w3.org</EM> noting the
version of the Library. <P>

You can also find a list of bugs under the <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/Bugs.html">CERN Server</A>, the <A
HREF="../../../Arena/Status.html">Arena Browser</A>, and the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Defaults/Bugs.html">Line Mode Browser</A>.<P>

<H2><A NAME="z3">From Schulmberger Oct 93</H2>

<UL>
<LI>flatten tree structure, obj and src in same dir as src a ala Gnu, etc etc
<LI>Use Gnu configure!
<LI>Document config options
<LI>Redundant config changes <LI>Shell scripts expect only one config (no NIS handling)
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="z1">From WWW Workshop July 1993</A></H2>

These were brought up at the <A
HREF="../../../WorkingNotes/Overview.html#z45" NAME="z2">workshop</A>.

<UL>
<LI>Nested lists into parser, GridText, Styles. <LI>(test dataset for HTML+) <L
>VMS compilation of library, please  --- Done<LI>Collapse spaces in free (not PRE) text <LI>Problem with CopyNoCR in mac? should map (13,10) onto \n.
<LI>FTP: HTProgress() message about transfer size, to allow informed abort. <LI>Scan of unknown file with intelligent disposition would be useful.
<LI>Stream:
Extra method "close_abort()" to close in error? Allow error to be passed down.
<LI>HTParseSocket doesn't return an error on truncated data.
<LI>Internationalize:
Numbered messages instead of strings <LI>Structured streams also handled by
HTStreamStack <LI>Distribution:
generate diffs, please <LI>CVS remote access please for helpers
<LI>Documentation: More philosophy about how to use the library.
More on configuration options.
<LI>Anchor objects: how to make them more memory-efficent? Efficient freeing?
Restrict its use to HTML.c? <LI>Source caching in client.
Needs: HTTee -- a stream T piece, cacheWriter (see HTWAIS).
In anchor, put cache format and filename.
<LI>Callback for "loading" mailto: URLs.
<LI>WAIS and Z3950 etc <LI>TITLE accumulates CRLFs from input stream! Wrong...
<LI>Space after &lt;dd> in list causes 1 characetr indent <LI>Library build:
WTMP in released makefile should be $(WWW) so users don't get confused -- Lou.
</UL><H2>Before that:</H2><UL>
<LI>Add rcp access to the "file" access method if it is straightforward.
The rcp protocol was originally defined by the UCB code,
and still is perhaps best defined that way.
More recent retrospctive documentation exists (where?) <LI>Add code to save
back files by HTTP or FTP,
and code to REGENERATE HTML from a styled hypertext.
<LI>Authentication &amp; privacy -- implement HTTP specs for this.
<LI>In each protocol access module,
put timeouts on both connect() and read() using non-blocking mode and select()
to allow user-defined covering timeouts for document retrieval.
A little common code here would be useful,
allowing also platform-dependent "Abort" buttons on long transfers.
<LI>Makefile -- complete dependencies</UL> <P>
