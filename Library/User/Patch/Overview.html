<H1>Known Bugs in Library of Common Code</H1>

The list of known bugs are in reverse chronological order.<P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/caution.gif"> If you (very unlikely) have
discovered a new <B>BUG</B> or just have a great idea - pronounced
patches ;-) then please mail <EM>libwww@w3.org</EM> noting the
version of the Library. <P>

See also the <A HREF="Workinglist.html">Working List</A> to see what
we are planning to do. You can also find a list of bugs under the <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/Bugs.html">CERN Server</A>, the <A
HREF="../../../Arena/Status.html">Arena Browser</A>, and the <A

<H2>Before that</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Add rcp access to the "file" access method if it is

retrospctive documentation exists (where?) <LI>Add code to save back
files by HTTP or FTP, and code to REGENERATE HTML from a styled
hypertext.
