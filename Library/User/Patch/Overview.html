<H1>Known Bugs and Patches</H1>

The list of known bugs are in reverse chronological order. Please report bugs or bug-fixes to <A
HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A> noting the version of the Library and what caused the
bug to appear. <P>

The <A HREF="../Patch/">provided patches</A> are relative to the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory in the
distribution tree. In order to apply a patch, do the following in the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory:

<OL>

<LI>Download the patch, for example <EM>lib-1.fix</EM>

<LI>Invoke the patch command by typing 

<PRE>
	patch &lt; lib-1.fix
</PRE>

<LI>Rebuild the code by typing

<PRE>
	make clobber
	./BUILD library
</PRE>
</OL>

<H2>Library 4.0</H2>

<UL>

<LI>HTML Machinary is still missing a great deal. However this part is now isolated into the
SGML-HTML-HText stream pipe and will be replaced by a new parser as soon as possible in connection
with the development of Arena.

<LI>Directory listings do not work completely on Windows NT

<LI>How do we get rid of the BUILD script?

<LI>TRACE macro conflicts with macro on NT. Replace it with WWWTRACE
</UL>

<H2>Library 3.1</H2>

<DT>Bug in time stamp on files in FTP directory listings

<DD>The Library supports "long" directory listings for FTP Unix, VMS
and Windows NT servers with file type, size, time and date
etc. However, the time stamp is wrong by one hour for files created
when dayligt savingtime is enabled. The reason is that the FTP module
in the Library doesn't know the timezone of the remote FTP server and
hence doesn't know when DSR is enabled or disabled. This is fixed in
the next version

<DT><A HREF="../Patch/lib_3.1_1.fix">Problem with nested HTML tags in the HTML parser</A>

<DD>A bug which makes the HTML parser crash if is gets more than 20
nested HTML tags. Thanks to Robert M. Fleischman for pointing this
out!

</UL>

<H2>Library 3.0</H2>

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../Patch/lib_3.0_1.fix">Problems with redicection</A>

<DD>Until now all HTTP servers have sent back a small HTML document with a 
redirection message going:

<PRE>
	If you can see this message then your browser
	does not support automatic redirection.
</PRE>

However, new severs like Netscape and other servers don't send this
and hence no stream should be set up. This confuses the Library and it
dumps core.
