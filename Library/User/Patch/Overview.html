<H1>Known Bugs in W3C Reference Library</H1>

The list of known bugs are in reverse chronological order.<P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/caution.gif"> If you (very unlikely) have discovered a new <B>BUG</B>
or just have a great idea - pronounced patches ;-) then please mail <A
HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A> noting the version of the Library. See also the <A
HREF="Workinglist.html">Working List</A> to see what we are planning to do. You can also find a list
of bugs under the <A HREF="../../../Daemon/Bugs.html">CERN Server</A>, the <A
HREF="../../../Arena/">Arena Browser</A>, and the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Defaults/Bugs.html">Line Mode Browser</A>.<P>

<H2>Library 4.0</H2>

<UL>

<LI>HTML Machinary is still missing a great deal. However this part is now isolated into the
SGML-HTML-HText stream pipe and will be replaced by a new parser as soon as possible in connection
with the development of Arena.

<LI>Directory listings do not work completely on Windows NT

<LI>How do we get rid of the BUILD script?

<LI>TRACE macro conflicts with macro on NT. Replace it with WWWTRACE
</UL>

<H2>Library 3.1</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Bug in time stamp on files in FTP directory listings. The Library supports "long" directory
listings for FTP Unix, VMS and Windows NT servers with file type, size, time and date etc. However,
the time stamp is wrong by one hour for files created when dayligt savingtime is enabled. The reason
is that the FTP module in the Library doesn't know the timezone of the remote FTP server and hence
doesn't know when DSR is enabled or disabled.

</UL>

<H2><A NAME="z3">From Schulmberger Oct 93</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Use Gnu configure!
<LI>Complete dependencies in Makefile
<LI>Document config options
<LI>Redundant config changes
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="z1">From WWW Workshop July 1993</A></H2>

These were brought up at the workshop.

<UL>
<LI>Nested lists into parser, GridText, Styles.
<LI>Collapse spaces in free (not PRE) text
<LI>FTP: HTProgress() message about transfer size, to allow informed abort.
</UL>
