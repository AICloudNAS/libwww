<H1>Known Bugs and Patches</H1>

The list of known bugs are in reverse chronological order. Please report bugs or bug-fixes to <A
HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A> noting the version of the Library and what caused the
bug to appear.

<H2>Library 4.0</H2>

<UL>

<LI>HTML Machinary is still missing a great deal. However this part is now isolated into the
SGML-HTML-HText stream pipe and will be replaced by a new parser as soon as possible in connection
with the development of Arena.

<LI>Directory listings do not work completely on Windows NT

<LI>How do we get rid of the BUILD script?

<LI>TRACE macro conflicts with macro on NT. Replace it with WWWTRACE
</UL>

<H2>Library 3.1</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Bug in time stamp on files in FTP directory listings. The Library supports "long" directory
listings for FTP Unix, VMS and Windows NT servers with file type, size, time and date etc. However,
the time stamp is wrong by one hour for files created when dayligt savingtime is enabled. The reason
is that the FTP module in the Library doesn't know the timezone of the remote FTP server and hence
doesn't know when DSR is enabled or disabled.

</UL>
