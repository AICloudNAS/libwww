<H1>Important Data Structures</H1>

The Library contains many data structures, which all are defined in
the HTML files in the source code. This document introduces the most
important data structures and how they are interconnected. The
structures are illustrated in the figure:

<P><IMG SRC="DataStructures.gif"><P>

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="request" HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest Structure</A>

<DD>The <CODE>request</CODE> structure is the central data structure
in the Library. It contains information intended for the client
application, the server application and for the Library itself for how
to fulfill a request. As this is a normal C structure, any application
can see all the information available. However, it is strongly
recommended only to use the information specifically intended to be
used by the application in question. The default values of the
structure make it very easy for a client to load a document, either if
it is using an <A HREF="Anchors.html">anchor</A> or an <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/Addressing.html">URI</A>.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#anchor">HTAnchor
Structure</A>

<DD>The anchor structure is a generic superclass used for both
<CODE>parent</CODE> anchors and <CODE>child</CODE> anchors. Both types
have a specific structure which is a subclass of the generic
structure. It contains all information about relations among URIs and
whether they have been loaded or not.

<DT><A HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.c">HyperDoc
Structure</A>

<DD>The <CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> structure is only declared in the
Library - the real definition is left to the client application. For
the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/Status.html">Line Mode Browser</A>, it
is defined in the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.c">GridText Module</A>
where it is called <CODE>_HText</CODE>. It contains all information
needed to present and manage a <A
HREF="Overview#GraphicObject">graphic object</A>. The client is
responsible for allocating and freeing all <CODE>graphic
objects</CODE> which is a question about speed versus available
resources. When the object is freed, the link from the <CODE>anchor
structure</CODE> must be put to <CODE>NULL</CODE>. The dotted line
symbolizes that it is free for the client to create a
<CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> object including a link to the
<CODE>request</CODE> structure.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#HTNetInfo">HTNetInfo
Structure</A>

<DD>This structure is an internal structure used by the <A
HREF="Protocol.html">Protocol Modules</A> and contains the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTFormat.html#z15">input read buffer</A>,
socket number and other information relevant for the access to the
network.

</DL>

When a resource is requested, the Library does the following to obtain
the graphic object:

<UL>

<LI>Finds or creates an <A HREF="Anchors.html">anchor</A> object for
the URI given

<LI>Checks if link in the <CODE>anchor</CODE> structure to the
<CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> is non-NULL. If this is the case, the object is
already in memory and ready for presentation.

<LI>If not then the <A HREF="Overview.html#ClientCache">local
cache</A> (if any) is searched to find the resource. If it is found
then the resource is parsed and the graphic object recreated.

<LI>If the <A HREF="Overview#GraphicObject">graphic object</A> is not
in memory and the resource is not stored in the local cache then the
resource must be loaded through the network.

</UL>
