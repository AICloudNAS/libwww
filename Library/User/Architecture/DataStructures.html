<H1>Important Data Structures</H1>

**************

The Library contains many data structures of which most are for
internal only and will not normally be referenced directly from
outside the Library. However, as the definition of a graphic object is
done by the application and not by the Library, a the following figure
gives a quick overview of the three most important data structures (or
objects) and how they are interconnected.

</P><IMG SRC="DataStruc.gif" ALT="Structures"></P>

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="request"
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest
structure</A></DT>

<DD>The <CODE>request</CODE> structure contains information intended
for the client application, the server application and for the Library
itself for how to fulfill a request. The default values of the
structure are appropiate for a client loadinf a document from either
an <A HREF="../../../Architecture/Anchors.html" >anchor</A> or a <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/Addressing.html">URI</A>.
 Managing <CODE>requests</CODE> is described in section <A HREF="#request">
The Request Object</A></DD>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#anchor">HTAnchor
structure</A> </DT>

<DD><A HREF="../Terms.html#anchor">Anchors</A> represent any objects
which may be the sources or destinations of hypertext links. Anchors
contain all information about the object, whether it has been loaded,
known metainformation about the object (language, media type etc.),
and relations to other objects. Managing <CODE>anchors</CODE> is
described in section <A HREF="#anchor">The Anchor Object</A></DD>
<DT><A HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.c">HyperDoc
structure</A> </DT>

<DD>The <CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> structure is only declared in the
Library - the definition is left to the client application. For the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Status.html">Line Mode Browser</A>, it is
defined in the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.c">GridText Module</A>
where it is called <CODE>_HText</CODE>. It contains all information
needed to present and manage a <A HREF="Overview#GraphicObject">
graphic object</A>. The client is responsible for allocating and
freeing all <CODE>graphic objects</CODE> which may entail tradeoffs of
speed versus available resources. When the object is freed, the link
from the <CODE>anchor structure</CODE> must be put to
<CODE>NULL</CODE>. The dotted line symbolizes that it is free for the
client to create a <CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> object including a link to
the <CODE>request</CODE> structure.  </DD>

</DL>

**************

The Library contains many data structures, which all are defined in
the HTML files in the source code. This document introduces the most
important data structures and how they are interconnected. The
structures are illustrated in the figure:

<P><IMG SRC="DataStructures.gif"><P>

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="request" HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest Structure</A>

<DD>The <CODE>request</CODE> contains information intended for the
client application, the server application and for the Library itself
for how to fulfill a request. As this is a normal C structure, any
application can see all the information available. However, it is
strongly recommended only to use the information specifically intended
to be used by the application in question. The default values of the
structure make it very easy for a client to load a document, either if
it is using an <A HREF="Anchors.html">anchor</A> or an <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/Addressing.html">URI</A>.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#anchor">HTAnchor
Structure</A>

<DD>The anchor structure is a generic superclass used for both
<CODE>parent</CODE> anchors and <CODE>child</CODE> anchors. Both types
have a specific structure which is a subclass of the generic
structure. It contains all information about relations among URIs and
whether they have been loaded or not.

<DT><A HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.c">HyperDoc
Structure</A>

<DD>The <CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> structure is only declared in the
Library - the real definition is left to the client application. For
the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>, it
is defined in the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.c">GridText Module</A>
where it is called <CODE>_HText</CODE>. It contains all information
needed to present and manage a <A
HREF="Overview#GraphicObject">graphic object</A>. The client is
responsible for allocating and freeing all <CODE>graphic
objects</CODE> which is a question about speed versus available
resources. When the object is freed, the link from the <CODE>anchor
structure</CODE> must be put to <CODE>NULL</CODE>. The dotted line
symbolizes that it is free for the client to create a
<CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> object including a link to the
<CODE>request</CODE> structure.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#HTNetInfo">HTNetInfo
Structure</A>

<DD>This structure is an internal structure used by the <A
HREF="Protocol.html">Protocol Modules</A> and contains the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTFormat.html#z15">input read buffer</A>,
socket number and other information relevant for the access to the
network.

</DL>

When a resource is requested, the Library does the following to obtain
the graphic object:

<UL>

<LI>Finds or creates an <A HREF="Anchors.html">anchor</A> object for
the URI given

<LI>Checks if link in the <CODE>anchor</CODE> structure to the
<CODE>HyperDoc</CODE> is non-NULL. If this is the case, the object is
already in memory and ready for presentation.

<LI>If not then the <A HREF="Overview.html#ClientCache">local
cache</A> (if any) is searched to find the resource. If it is found
then the resource is parsed and the graphic object recreated.

<LI>If the <A HREF="Overview#GraphicObject">graphic object</A> is not
in memory and the resource is not stored in the local cache then the
resource must be loaded through the network.

</UL>
