The W3C Reference Library, a.k.a. Library of Common Code, is a general
code base that can be used as a basis for building clients, servers
and many other Web applications. It contains reference code for
accessing HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local
file system. Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and
presenting hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic
programming utilities. The Library is the basis for many <A
HREF="../">World-Wide Web</A> applications and the W3C reference
applications are built on top of it. This document is the first of
three documents that each describes different aspects of the Library:

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="Overview.html"><IMG ALT="Architecture" SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/Spec48x.gif"></A> <B>The Architecture</B>

<DD>The current document is the first in the series and it describes
the architecture of the Library without referring directly to the code
itself. This is the "designer view" where bugs are a unknown
phenomenon.

<DT><A HREF="../Using/"><IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/guide48x.gif" ALT="Using"></A> <B>The User's Guide</B>

<DD>The second document introduces the "official" API of the
Library. This document represents the "User's view" and should be
sufficient to use the Library without being aware of what's going on
underneeth the interface. It is also the API that is least exposed to
changes. The description contains a set of examples.

<DT><A HREF="../Guide/"><IMG ALT="Internals" SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/Tang48x.gif"></A> <B>The Internals and Programmer's Guide</B>

<DD>The last document in the serie presents all modules in the Library
regardles if they are part of the API described in the User's Guide or
not. This is also known as the "hacker's view" of the Library.

Each part of the documentation is also available as <A

printout. As a result, the relative links in this document do not

The current documentation is based on version 3.1 which is to be
released July 1995.<P>
