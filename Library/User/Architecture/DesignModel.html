<H1>Design Model</H1>

The Library is designed to be easily extended with new functionality
as new Internet standards evolve for transportation and representation
of data objects. This means that most of the functionality is placed
in separate modules that can be hooked onto a basic set of modules
called the "core entity". This design model is illustrated in the
figure below:

<P><IMG SRC="Design.gif" ALT="Design"><P>

The figure is similar to a protocol stack where the lower layers
provide a set of services to the upper layers. This is also the case
in the Library where the "layering" is as follows:

<DL>

<DT>Generic tools

<DD>The Library provides a large set of generic utility modules such
as various container classes, string utilities etc. They have the
important function to separate the upper layer code from platform
specific implementations using a large set of macros that makes the
Library more portable. The modules are used throughout the Library
itself and can easily be employed in many applications.

<DT>Core entity

<DD>The fundamental part of the Library is actually quite small. The
core entity is not a closed entity but an open frame construction that
provides hooks for the dynamic modules. The core entity also contains
the major access points for applications issuing requests, for example
to access a data object. Many of the sections in this paper contain
references to the core entity and explain the interaction between the
core entity and an application.

<DT>Access and stream modules

<DD>These modules are often referred to as "dynamic modules" as they
can be enabled or disabled dynamically during execution of an
application (using static linking). There are several ways to
initialize the dynamic modules:

<OL>

<LI>Through a configuration file (often called a rule file) which is
parsed, for example at start up time;

<LI>Using static initialization functions which are set up at compile
time;

<LI>By initializing the modules during execution as the application
requires it.

</OL>The Library has a set of default, static initialization functions
which can be found in the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTInit.html">
HTInit module</A>. By default they enable all the dynamic modules in
the Library, but this can be changed as described later.

<DT>Application Modules

<DD>The application modules are often specific for client applications
including functions that require user interaction, management of
history lists etc. The reference implementation of these modules in
the reference code is mainly intended for character based applications
like the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>. More
advanced clients will often have to override them, that is, a module
with an identical interface is provided by the application, and the
loading of the default module suppressed.  </DL>

When writing an application most of the code interacting with the
Library will consist of access modules, stream modules, and
application modules. These modules can either provide additional
functionality or override existing functionality in the Library in
order to make use of more platform dependent implementations. The
latter will typically be the case with the application modules which
must be adjusted to a given graphic platform.
