<H1>Post Webs - an API for PUT and POST</H1>

The <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A> PUT and POST are required
features when extending the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org">Web</A> to a
fully collaborative tool with features like remote authoring,
annotations, update of data bases etc. Many Web applications are
currently capable of transferring data from HTML forms to a HTTP
server. However, form data is typically small amounts of text based
data, and a more generic mechanism is needed for transmitting an
arbitrary data object to any kind of remote server. This document
describes how this functionality can be provided by the "Post Web"
model and how this model interacts with the user, the application, and
the <A HREF="../../">W3C Reference Library</A>. One of the advantages
of this model is that it does not require any modification, neither to
the <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP/1.0</A> specification nor to
the <A HREF="../../../MarkUp/">HTML</A> form definition. <P>

<H2>What is a Post Web?</H2>

A "Post Web" is used as an abstraction mechanism for enabling the user
to perform multiple operations (methods) on a data object rendered in
multiple representations determined for multiple destinations. This
may seem complicated but the Post Web is in fact a very simple model as
will become clear in the following sections. <P>

The purpose of the Post Web is to take a set of common situations
taken from the world of email and news; merge it with the features of
HTTP, and put the result into the Web model. This leads to the
following set of requirements:

<UL>

<LI>A post operation can involve one source and a multiple number of
destinations.

<LI>The source and any of the destinations can be references to either
local or remote data objects.

<LI>The model must provide data format conversion from one media type
to another on the fly when posting a data object. The data conversion
can either be performed on the data going to all destinations or on
individual destinations.

<LI>The user must be able to specify a relation between a source and
any of the destinations, for example "Written by".
 
<LI>It must be possible to specify individual methods used for each
destination, for example, if three destinations are specified then one
can use PUT, another POST, and the third can use LINK.

<LI>The Library must be able to handle access authentication and
redirection on both the source and each of the destinations.

</UL>

The Post Web model provides a homogeneous interface to the posting
operation regardless of the destination, the method, and the data
format as this conceptually is the same operation. It describes the
full operation from defining the source and destinations to actually
transfer the data over the network. This process involves there
players: the user, the application, and the Library. Each of these
uses the Post Web model but on different levels of abstraction:

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="#user">The user</A>
<DD>To the user, the Post Web is a naming scheme identifying the
source and destination and how the destinations are related to the
source.

<DT><A HREF="#client">The application</A>
<DD>The application sees the operation as a change in the topology of
the Web and communicates this change to the Library.

<DT><A HREF="#library">The Library</A>
<DD>The Library interprets the Post Web as a set of related requests
specifying the access scheme, the operation to be done, the data flow
between them, and the data formats in this data flow.
</DL>

The following paragraphs describe the three layers of abstraction and
how they are interconnected and thus defining the Post Web model.

<H2><A NAME="user">The User Builds a Post Web</A></H2>

The description of the Post Web model includes a basic example in
which a user wants to post the same data object or variations thereof
to two mailing lists, a news group and at the same time store the data
object on a remote HTTP server. This scenario can be graphically
represented as a Post Web consisting of five nodes: one source and
four destinations:

<P><IMG SRC="PostWebUser.gif" ALT="User's View"><P>

This document does not specify the user interface for building a Post
Web as this is tightly connected to the platform involved, but
obviously it should take advantage of any graphic features
etc. Typically a GUI-client could use drag-and-drop icons for building
the Web. For example, the Post Web could be visualized using a
collection of icons representing commonly used recipients and then let
the user drag lines between the data object to be posted and the
recipients. <P>

On each of the four destinations, the user can specify what method
should be applied and any relations between the source and any of the
destinations. The relations are identical to the <A
HREF="../../../MarkUp/">HTML</A> "Link" tag and the <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A> "Link" header, and it can for
example describe authorship, relations to other data objects etc.<P>

When the user has finished specifying the source, the destinations,
the methods, and any relations between them, the application can take
this information and convert it to a lower abstraction level.

<H2><A NAME="application">The Application Generates a Request</A></H2>

To the application, the Post Web is a request for change in the
topology of the Web. The application can describe this change in the
internal Library representation of the Web based on the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#anchor">HTAnchor</A> object
as described in section "<A HREF="Anchors.html">Anchor
Objects</A>". In the figure below, any of the addresses or data
objects may or may not exist when the Post Web is submitted by the
application. Depending on whether it is on the source side or on the
destination this may or may not be an error situation.

<P><IMG SRC="PostWebApp.gif" ALT="Application's View"><P>

The Library provides an API for handling anchor objects including how
to link the objects together as indicated in the figure above. This is
explained in more detail in the <A HREF="User's Guide">User's
Guide</A>. <P>

<H2><A NAME="library">The Library Serves the Request</A></H2>

When the application has bound the source anchor to the destination
anchors with the appropriate methods and link relations, the Post Web
can be handed over to the Library in order to transfer the data object
from the source to the destinations. The Library is responsible for
handling the actual protocol communication, and hence this part of the
Post Web model is the lowest layer of abstraction. Therefore the
design goals for this layer of the Post Web is somewhat more technical
than the first two layers:

<UL>

<LI>Posting to multiple destinations must be compatible with libwww
threads and extern thread implementations. In the case of libwww
threads, it must use non-blocking, interruptible I/O.

<LI>The Library must be capable of handling concurrent write and read
operations to and from the network.

<LI>There must be no timing requirements that can lead to race
conditions between any of the destinations and the source or between
destinations.

<LI>Redirections and access authentication must be handled on both the
source side and any of the destinations.

</UL>

Internally, the Library represents a Post Web in two different ways: A
<EM>static</EM> and a <EM>dynamic</EM> binding between the source the
destinations. The static binding is created when the application
issues the request, and it exists until all the sub-requests in the
Post Web have reached a final state. The dynamic binding depends on
the data flow and exists only as long as data is passed through the
Post Web. The dynamic binding can be set up and taken down
independently of the static binding, and often this happens multiple
times during the handling of a request. <P>

As described in the section "<A HREF="DataStructures.html#request">Central
Data Structures</A>", the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTRequest.html">HTRequest</A> structure is
one of the central data structures used to describe a request from the
application. This structure is used in the static binding between the
source and the destinations and it is initialized as soon as the
request is passed to the Library from the application.

<P><IMG SRC="PostWebReq.gif" ALT="libwww's Request View"><P>

At this point no information is known about the data object itself, so
the static binding only contains information about who the source and
the destinations are. The dynamic binding carries information about
data format, content length and other essential metainformation about
the object. The dynamic binding is basically a stream chain that is
established as this information gets available from the source
server:<P>

<P><IMG SRC="PostWebStream.gif" ALT="libwww's Stream View"><P>

<OL>

<LI>As soon as the source server (which might be the local file system
or a remote HTTP server) is ready to accept a request, it is sent of
by the Library.

<LI>The Library then waits until the source server starts sending back
a response. In the mean time, the application can issue request other
requests as the model is based on non-blocking I/O.

<LI>As soon as data arrives and the data format is identified, the
dynamic bindings between the source and the destinations can be
setup. The binding is basically a connection between the target of the
source request and the input of any of the destination requests.In the
case of multiple destination, T-streams can be added to supply the
required number of outgoing data flows.

<LI>The destination is now ready for transmitting a request. In the
case of HTTP, the destination request can not be transmitted before
the full header is known, which is when the meta information from the
source data object is parsed.

<LI>A response will arrive to each of the destination requests
determining whether the posting can continue or not.

<LI>When the dynamic binding is established, any data format
conversion can be inserted between the target of the source request
and the input of any of the destination requests. A converter can
either be placed directly at the target or on any of the inputs, so
that all destinations can have different renditions of the data
object. As the content length often will change as a converter other
than a through line is used, it can be required to insert a content
length counter stream which will buffer the data object before it is
emitted from the stream.

</OL>

<H2>Updating the Web Topology</H2>

The application can use the result of the operation returned from the
Library to either regard the change in the topology of the Web as
successful, erroneous, or any degree in between. The application can
use this information to for example update any graphical visualization
of the part of the Web that the user has traversed. <P>

The result of posting a data object varies from protocol to
protocol. Typically transaction oriented protocols can provide an
immediate result whereas relayed protocols can not. As a general rule
in the design of the Library other protocols than HTTP should be
supported but not extended beyond their individual limitations. This
means that the Library has to be flexible enough to handle more than
one result from a posting transaction dependent on the protocol
used. As an example, an immediate result from a post transaction is
available using NNTP or HTTP whereas the result from SMTP might be
delayed several days. In practice there is no way that the application
can await a response for that amount of time, and it should therefore
be treated as "Accepted" with no guarantee of completeness.
