<H1>Anchor Description</H1>

<A HREF="../../../Terms.html#anchor">Anchors</A> represent any
references to graphic objects which may be the sources or destinations
of hypertext links. Here follows a general description of their
implementation in the <A HREF="../../Status.html">WWW Library of
Common Code</A>. There are basically two types of anchors:

<DL>
<DT><EM>parent anchors</EM></DT>

<DD>Represents whole graphic objects. That is, the target of a link
pointing to a parent anchor is the full contents of the graphic
object.  A parent anchor is made the target of a link by making a
<CODE>HREF</CODE> without any <CODE>#</CODE> appended to the URI.</DD>

<DT><EM>child anchors</EM></DT>

<DD>Represents subparts of a graphic object. A subpart is declared by
making a <CODE>NAME</CODE> tag in the anchor declaration. A child
anchor is the target of a link if the <CODE>HREF</CODE> link
declaration contains a <CODE>#</CODE> appended to the URI.</DD>

</DL>

The anchors are organized into a <EM>sub-web</EM> which represents the
part of the web that the application (often through user interaction)
has been in touch with. In this sub-web, any anchor can be the source
of zero, one, or many links and it may be the target of zero, one, or
many links. That is, any anchor can point to and be pointed to by any
number of links. Having an anchor being the source of many links is
often used in the <CODE>POST</CODE> method, where for example the same
data object is to posted to a News group, a mailing list and a HTTP
server. <P>

Every request and hence every graphic object has a parent anchor
associated with it. Anchors exist throughout the lifetime of the
application, but as this generally is not the case for graphic
objects, it is possible to have a parent anchor without a graphic
object. If the data object is stored in the client cache, the parent
anchor contains a link to it so that the client can access it through
the <A HREF="Overview.html#ClientCache">Cache Manager</A>. <P>

Both types of anchors are subclasses of a <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#Generic">generic anchor
class</A> which defines a set of outgoing links to where the anchor
points. The relationship between parent anchors and child anchors is
illustrated in the figure.

<P><A NAME="Anchors"><IMG ALT="Anchors" SRC="anchor.gif"></A><P>

Every parent anchor points to a remote data object. In the case of
posting an anchor to a remote server, the data object is yet to be
created. The client can assign a URI for the object but it might be
overridden (or completely denied) by the remote server. In the figure,
parent <B>A</B> has no associated graphic object. This can either be
because the anchor has not yet been requested by the user or the
graphic object has been discarded from memory. <P>

When child <B>B1</B> is created, pointing to parent <B>A</B>, parent
<B>B</B> is registered in parent <B>A</B> as pointing to <B>A</B>. The
same is the case for the link between child <B>BL</B> and <B>A2</B>,
but parent <B>B</B> is only registered once in parent <B>A</B> (this
is marked with <EM>b</EM> in the figure). The same is the case for the
links marked <EM>a</EM> and <EM>c</EM>.  <P>
