<H1>Utilities</H1>

This document covers the basic programming utilities that can be used
in the client or server to make life easier. The topics are:

<LI><A HREF="#Container">Container Modules</A>

<A NAME="Container"><H2>Container Modules</H2></A>

These modules are generic data object storage modules that might be used
wherever convenient. The general rule for freeing memory from these modules is
that free methods handles data structures generated within the modules whereas
user data is for the caller to free. The modules consist of:

<P>

<DT><A NAME="z59" HREF="../../Implementation/HTBTree.html">Binary Trees</A>

<DD>This is a complete balanced binary tree that might be used for storage
and sort of a large number of data objects, e.g. filenames in directory
listings etc.

<DT><A NAME="z50" HREF="../../Implementation/HTChunk.html">Chunks</A>

<DD>A Chunk is a blockwise expandable array of type (char *) and is a sort of
apology for real strings in C. Chunks make it easier to handle dynamic strings
of unknown size. It is often faster than using the String Copy Routines</A>.

<DT><A NAME="z77" HREF="../../Implementation/HTList.html">Linked Lists</A>

<DD>This module provides the functionality for managing a generic list of data
objects. The module is implemented as a single linked list using the scheme
<EM>first in - last out (FILO)</EM>.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAssoc.html">Association Lists</A>

<DD>This is a small module build on top of HTList that provides a way to
store <EM>Name-Value</EM> pairs in an easy way.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTString.html">Strings</A>

<DD>A few manipulation routines for dynamic arrays of characters. The
routines include string copy, case insensitive comparison etc.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAtom.html">Atoms</A>

<DD>Atoms are strings which are given representative pointer values so that
they can be stored more efficiently, and comparisons for equality done more
efficiently. The pointer values are in fact entries into a hash table.

</DL>

<H2><A NAME="ErrorAlert">Error Message and Information Handling</A></H2>

These modules are available for handling information and parse it from the
Library back to the user: <P>

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="z64" HREF="../../Implementation/HTAlert.html">HTAlert User Messages</A>

<DD>This modules contains the code for prompting the user for file names,
userid, password etc. Furthermore, it presents messages containing status
information, error messages etc. to the user. The implementation in the
library is meant for the Line Mode Browser (i.e. it writes to stderr) but can
easily be overwritten by GUI browsers.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTError.html">HTError Module</A>

<DD>This module maintains an message stack within the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess#z1"> HTRequest Structure</A>. The module classifies
messages in the range from <I>Information</I> to <I>Fatal
Error</I>. As an example, the new <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/URL/Overview.html"> URI</A> specified in a
<A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html#z10">HTTP Redirection</A>
gets parsed back to the user so that a clever client can edit the link
directly.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTErrorMsg.c">HTErrorMsg</A>

<DD>This module is in fact a part of the HTError module but a this is written
specifically for a browser like Line Mode Browser, GUI clients would like to
overwrite it. It presents the content of the message stack to the user in a
readable form. Often, the information could be shown in a separate information
window in the client.

</DL>


<A NAME="URI"><H2>URI Management</H2></A>

The functionality for handling URIs is placed in the following modules:

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTParse.html">HTParse</A>

<DD>This module provides functions for parsing URIs, simplify them by
removing redundant information.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTEscape.html">HTEscape</A>

<DD>This module can search a URI for unsafe characteres and escape and
unescape them according to the <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html">URI
Specifications</A>.

</DL>

<A NAME="Basic"><H2>Basic Utilities</H2></A>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/caution.gif"> Look into these modules
before you start defining system dependent stuff. Most things are
already defined here! The list of basic utility modules are currently
as follows

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="z47" HREF="tcp.html">System specifics</A>

<DD>The tcp.h file includes system-specific include files and flags for I/O
to network and disk. The only reason for this file is that the Internet world
is more complicated than Posix and ANSI.

<DT><A NAME="z48" HREF="../../Implementation/HTUtils.html">HTUtils</A>

<DD>The HTUtil.h file includes things we need everywhere, generally macros
for declarations, booleans, etc.
