<H1>Central Data Structures</H1>

The central data structures are the structures that are a part of the
core entity. Each of the core modules as explained in section "<A
HREF="../Architecture/ControlFlow.html">Control and Data Flow</A>"are
relying on one or more of the central data structures. This section
describes the relationship between the core modules and the central
data structures <EM>and</EM> the relationship between the central data
structures themselves. <P>

<H2>Anchors</H2>

All anchor management is handled by the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#anchor">HTAnchor module</A>. You
should normally not have to look directly into the HTAnchor structure,
but use the methods provided by the anchor manager.

<H2>Request</H2>

The <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest
structure</A> is defined in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html">access manager</A>. It is
currently not a completely opaque data structure but it will soon be
so be prepared to use methods like the ones to handle the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html">HTAnchor Object</A> Then we
can also better call it an object and not a data structure ;-).

<H2>Streams</H2>

Almost each stream module has its specific implementation of the
stream structure, but the generic one is defined in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTStream.html">HTStream Module</A>. The
structured stream definition is placed in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTStruct.html">HTStruct module</A>. None of
these modules have any code directly associated with - this is left to
the specific stream modules, for example the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">HTFWrite stream</A>.

<H2>HyperDoc Structure</H2>

The HyperDoc structure is different from the other central data
structures as it is only declared in the Library - the definition is
left to the application. It is intended to contain information about
data objects, especially hypertext objects that are to be presented to
a user. As an example of a definition, you can look at the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> where it is defined in
the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.html">GridText
module</A>. Here it is called "_HText" structure and it contains all
information needed to present and manage a data object in a text based
environment. <P>

Even though the Library does not interfere with the contents of the
HyperDoc object it does provide an API for managing the object. This
API is known as the "<A HREF="../../Implementation/HText.html">HText
API</A>" and it is described further in the User's Guide
