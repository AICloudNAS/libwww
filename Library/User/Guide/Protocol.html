<H1>Protocol Modules</H1>

A protocol module is invoked by the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTAccess manager</A> in
order to access a document. Each protocol module is responsible for
extracting information from a local file or remote server using a
particular protocol.  Depending on the protocol, the protocol module
either builds a graphic object (e.g.  hypertext) itself, or it passes
a socket descriptor to the format manager for parsing by one of the
parser modules. <P>

When the client parses a request to the library a <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1"> HTRequest Structure</A>
is filled out and parsed to a load function in the <CODE>access
manager</CODE>, for example <CODE>HTLoadAnchor</CODE>. HTRequest is a
hierarchical data structure that contains all information needed by
the client, the server and the library to fulfill the request. The
default values in the structure makes it very easy for the client to
do a normal request of a data object.

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="z46" HREF="../../Implementation/HTFile.html">File access</A>

<DD>This module provides access to files on a local file system. Due
to general confusion of the "file://" access scheme in the <A
HREF="../../../Addressing/URL/Overview.html">URL Specifications</A>
tries FTP access on failure, but this will be changed in a new major
release, June 1994, as it causes very long time out periods if a file
does not exist.

<DT><A NAME="z60" HREF="../../Implementation/HTFTP.html">FTP access</A>

<DD>This is a complete state based FTP client which is capable of
communicating with a lot of weird FTP servers. It uses
<CODE>PASV</CODE> as the default method for establishing the data
connection as <CODE>PORT</CODE> does not work if the application is
run from a firewall machine, as is often the case with <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/Proxies/Proxies.html">proxy server</A>.

<DT><A NAME="z45" HREF="../../Implementation/HTTP.html">HTTP access</A>

<DD>The <A NAME="25" HREF="../../Implementation/HTTP.html">HTTP
module</A> handles document search and retrieve using the <A NAME="6"
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">HTTP</A> protocol. See also
information on the <A HREF="../Architecture/HTTPFeatures.html"> current
implementation</A> of the HTTP client. The module is now a complete
state machine which is a required functionality in a <A
HREF="#multithread">multithreaded enviromnent</A>.

<DT><A NAME="z40" HREF="../../Implementation/HTNews.html">News access</A>

<DD>The NNTP internet news protocol is handled by HTNews which builds a
hypertext object. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/construction.gif"> This module is under
reconstruction!

<DT><A NAME="z44" HREF="../../Implementation/HTGopher.html">Gopher access</A>

<DD>The internet gopher access to menus and flat files (and links to telnet
nodes, WhoIs servers, CSO Name Server etc.) is handled by <A NAME="26"
HREF="../../Implementation/HTGopher.html">HTGopher Module</A>.

<DT><A NAME="z72" HREF="../../Implementation/HTTelnet.html">Telnet access</A>

<DD>This module provides the possibility of running telnet sessions in
a subshell. It also provides functionality for rlogin and tn3270.

<DT><A NAME="z39" HREF="../../Implementation/HTWAIS.html">WAIS access</A>

<DD>WAIS access is not compiled into the Library by default as it
requires the freeWAIS library. This is easily changed in the platform
dependent <CODE>Makefile.include</CODE> in the

<PRE>
	WWW/All/&lt;platform&gt;
</PRE>

directory. However, if this library is present then the application
can communicate directly with a WAIS server. Otherwise it must go
through a <A HREF="../../../Gateways/WAISGate.html"> gateway
program</A>.

</DL>

<H2>TCP Communication</H2>

The functionality of the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTTCP.html">HTTCP Module</A> covers several
topics but they are all related to TCP/IP communication. All active
and passive connection establishment from the <A
HREF="Overview.html#Protocol"> Protocol Modules</A> goes through this
module. Furthermore, the module manages a local host cache of visited
hosts so that the Domain Name Server is only consulted when
necessary.<P>

Other topics includes:

<UL>
<LI>I/O status indication (errno etc.)
<LI>Information on remote hosts
<LI>Information on local host (domain name etc.)
<LI>Information on current user (mail address)
</UL>


<A NAME="multithread"><H2>Multithreaded Clients</H2></A>

From version 3.0 (unreleased) of the Common Code Library,
multithreaded functionality has been added as an extra set of
modules. For the moment, only the HTTP module has multiple threads but
both FTP and Gopher are foreseen for the same functionality. For more
information, see <A HREF="../Architecture/Threads.html">Specifications
on Multiple threads</A>. The modules included are: <P>

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTThread.html">HTThread</A>

<DD>This module provides the functionality for registrating sockets as
ready for <CODE>read</CODE> or <CODE>write</CODE> (this includes the
<CODE>connect</CODE> statement that is basically a <CODE>write</CODE>
request). It is an internal module to the Library.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTEvent.html">HTEvent</A>

<DD>This is the Libray's own version of the event-loop serving the HTTP
client, and it is the application interface to the multithreaded Library. Clients can either use this module as is or they can overwrite it with their own even-loop. Note, that GUI-clients <EM>can</EM> use the current implementation!

</DL>

<H2>Reading Data from a Socket</H2>

To avoid reading directly from the socket a module has been put up to provide
an input buffer and some functionality to make it easier to get data from the
network.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFormat.html#z15"> Non-reentrant Reading Functions</A>

<DD>This module is a submodule of <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFormat.html">HTFormat</A> and it
provides the functionality of reading data from the network. When
multithreaded access gets incorporated it is essential that all requests to
the network goes through one point in the library. The reason keeping these is
to support the singlethreaded protocol access.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFormat.html#multi">Reentrant Reading Functions</A>

<DD>This is also a submodule of the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFormat.html">HTFormat</A> but
the difference from the other socket parsing module is that this is completely
reentrant. That is, it can be used together with a multithreaded client.

</DL>

The same is not yet the case for writing to a socket, but this is on the "to
do list".


<H2>Access Authorization</H2>

In order to prevent unauthorized access on a World-Wide Web server, a
basic authorization scheme has been developed, see <A
HREF="../../../AccessAuthorization/Overview.html"> Access
Authorization</A> for more details on the scheme. The access
authorization is implemented in the following modules:

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAABrow.html">HTAABrow</A>

<DD>This module contains WWW Browser specific code, that is composing
the <A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#9"> HTTP
Authorization Header</A>, recording users information etc.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTAAUtil.html">HTAAUtil</A>

<DD>This module contains the authorization code that is common to both the
servers and clients, e.g., handling information on different authentication
etc.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTUU.html">UU Encoding and Decoding</A>

<DD>Provides functions to encode and decode a data buffer according to
the <A
HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1421.txt">RFC
1421</A> "Privacy Enhancement for Internet Electronic Mail".

</DL>

<H2>Presenting Directory Listings and other Listings</H2>

When listings return from the protocol modules they are converted into HTML
and parsed to the client. Listings might be HTTP directory listings, Gopher
menus, FTP directory listings, CSO Name server etc. The modules providing this
functionality are:

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTDirBrw.html">HTDirBrw</A>

<DD>This is a very configurable module to actually present the listings

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTDescpt.html">HTDescript</A>

<DD>This module handles the description field in a HTTP directory listing.
For a HTML file, the default action is to peek the title of the document.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTIcons.html">HTIcons</A>

<DD>This module handles the set of icons used in the listings (HTTP, Gopher,
FTP etc.).

</DL>

<H2>Multi Linguistic Documents</H2>

The HTTP protocol provides the possibility of handling <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z12"> Multi Linguistic
Documents</A>.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTMulti.html">HTMulti</A>

<DD>This is the current implementation of the Multi Linguistic support in the
Library.
