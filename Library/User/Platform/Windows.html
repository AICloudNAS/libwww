<H1>Notes About Windows</H1>

<HR>

These are the installation and user notes for the <A
HREF="../../Status.html">Library of Common Code</A> and the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Status.html">Line Mode Browser</A>. Any
comments and suggestions are welcome at
<EM>libwww@info.cern.ch</EM>. <P>

As we only have some very old C compilers for the Windows platform,
and many of the problems have been fixed in newer version. This port
is still in a test phase so please comment! Special thanks to <EM>Paul
Hounslow, P.M.Hounslow@reading.ac.uk</EM>. See also the notes on <A
HREF="WindowsNT.html">Windows NT</A>

<DT><A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/winsocks.htm">WinSock
DLL</A>

<DD>The socket interface is based on a <A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/winsocks.htm">WinSock
DLL</A>, preferably a version greater than 1.1.

<DT>Dynamic Library (DLL)

<DD>The Library can't compile as a DLL out of the box. It requires
some modifications and possibly some minor patches. Please remember to
send the patches, so that we can put them in!

<DT>Direct <A HREF="../../../Daemon/WAISGate.html">WAIS</A> access

<DD>The normal possibility for linking with the WAIS library is not
possible on the Windows NT platform. Therefore the WWW Library module
<A HREF="../../Implementation/HTWAIS.c">HTWAIS</A> must be excluded in
the make file.

<DT>Memory Model

<DD>The memory model used should be <EM>LARGE</EM>. This has the
limitation that a single data object can't exceed 64K which might
cause problems in some situations.

<DT>Problem with 16 bit integers

<DD>Unfortunately most of the code in the Library is based on 32 bit
integers, so there will be overflow in some situations. One solution
is to redefine the <CODE>int</CODE> as <CODE>long</CODE> using a
<CODE>typedef</CODE> declaration.
