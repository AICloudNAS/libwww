Ok..  This is how to make shared version of the library, and make all binaryes
use it.

in WWW/Library/Implementation/CommonMakefile:

32,36d31
< # In order to link the binaryes in the package to the shared version of the
< # Library (HP-UX only) we must install it somplace, during compilation.
< # Specify where, here
< SHLIBDIR = /usr/local/lib/WWW
< 
66,68c61
< # To make HP-UX shared library, use line #2
< #CFLAGS2 = $(CFLAGS) $(WAISCFLAGS) -I$(CMN) $(SOCKS_FLAGS)
< CFLAGS2 = $(CFLAGS) +z $(WAISCFLAGS) -I$(CMN) $(SOCKS_FLAGS)
---
> CFLAGS2 = $(CFLAGS) $(WAISCFLAGS) -I$(CMN) $(SOCKS_FLAGS)

< # Again, line #2 for HP-UX shared Lib.
< #all : inc $(LOB)/libwww.a
< all : inc $(LOB)/libwww.a $(LOB)/libwww.sl
---
> all : inc $(LOB)/libwww.a

< # Uncomment the following to make the shared library for HP-UX... If you plan
< # to link httpd itself agains this library, make sure the cp line is there,
< # and fix WWW/Daemon/Implementation/CommonMakefile as documented there.
< # because it's not wise to link agains a shared lib that is in the Source tree.
< $(LOB)/libwww.sl : $(COMMON)
<       - rm $(LOB)/libwww.sl
<       ld -b -s -o $(LOB)/libwww.sl $(COMMON)
<       mkdir $(SHLIBDIR)
<       cp $(LOB)/libwww.sl $(SHLIBDIR)/libwww.sl
<       chmod a+x $(SHLIBDIR)/libwww.sl
< 
176c156
<       rm -f $(LOB)/libwww.a $(LOB)/libwww.sl
---
>       rm $(LOB)/libwww.a

in WWW/Daemon/Implementation/CommonMakefile:

37,38d36
< # Location of HP-UX shared library (if you want to link httpd againt it)
< SHLIBDIR = /usr/local/lib/WWW
59,61c57

< #LIBWWW = $(WTMP)/Library/$(WWW_MACH)/libwww.a
< LIBWWW = $(SHLIBDIR)/libwww.sl
---
> LIBWWW = $(WTMP)/Library/$(WWW_MACH)/libwww.a

in WWW/LineMode/Implementation/CommonMakefile:

30,31d29
< # Where the HP-UX Shared Library is
< SHLIBDIR = /usr/local/lib/WWW
62,64c60
< # Select which library you want to link agains .a or .sl (HP-UX only)

< WWWLIB = -L$(SHLIBDIR) -lwww
