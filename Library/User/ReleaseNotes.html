<H1>Library 3.1 Release Notes</H1>

This is the announcement of the first release of the Library of Common
Code from W3C. The release is called 3.1 prerelease 1 and is to be
considered as a beta version of the official release scheduled for
June. The code word for the June release is support for remote
collaborate work where people can use HTTP and the Web as a remote
authoring environment. The purpose of this release is to build and
maintain a close loop between W3C discussion and implementation
leading up to the final 3.1 June release. <P>

In addition to the new set of features and functionality this release
also is the first example of source code distributed under the W3C
conditions. This means that the code is available to consortium
members only within a month from the release date. <P>

Due to the limited distribution of the source code it is only
available from our <A HREF="../../../Dist/">HTTP server</A> and NOT
our FTP server. There is a new "<A HREF="Using/">User's Guide</A>" on
how to use the Library as a basic tool for Web applications and as
usual, we also have a "<A HREF="Guide/">Internals and Programmer's
Guide</A>". <P>

The Library is now under <A HREF="../../COPYRIGHT.html">MIT
copyright</A> and another new formality is that everybody who makes
modifications, contributions etc. and wishes to incorporate them as
part of the W3C software distribution <A
HREF="../../PATCHES.html">must sign a form</A> that gives MIT the
permissions to use the contributions under the terms of the W3C
software distribution. <P>

<H2>Library 3.1pre1 Release Notes</H2>

A lot of the work put into this release has been to update the API of
the Library. This is mainly described in the new "User Guide", so
please do read this and remember that comments are welcome!
