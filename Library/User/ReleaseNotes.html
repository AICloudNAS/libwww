The main features in this release are:
<UL>

    Full HTTP/1.1 sample implementation
  <LI>
    Advanced use of HTTP/1.1 Pipelining and persistent connections
  <LI>
    Persistent cache manager
</UL>
<P>
The focus for version 5.1 was to implement a high-performance HTTP/1.1 client
used as a testbed for the
"<A HREF="../../Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Pipeline.html">Network Performance
Effects of HTTP/1.1, CSS1, and PNG</A>" paper. Note that this code is sample
code so please take it as that and nothing more!

    Expression</A> (regex) library. This is used in the
    <A HREF="../../Robot/">Robot</A>, for example, to support
    <A HREF="../../Robot/User/CommandLine.html#Constraints">regular expressions
    on URIs</A> to include and exclude from a traversal. The code has been tested
    with the <A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/GNU/">GNU regex library</A>.
  <LI>
    Added more <A HREF="../../Robot/User/CommandLine.html#Logging">logging features
    to the webbot</A>
</UL>
<H3>
  Bug Fixes

<UL>
  <LI>
    Fixed bug in <A HREF="../src/HTWriter.html">ouputstream</A> that caused buffer

<H3>
  Bug Fixes

  Release 5.1c September 1997
</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Lots of bug fixes
</UL>
<H2>
  Release 5.1b April 1997
</H2>
<H3>
  Bug Fixes
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Fixed a problem in <A HREF="../src/HTRules.html">HTRules.c</A> as described
    in
    <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib-bugs/msg00248.html">this
    bug report</A>
  <LI>
    Fixed coredump problem in <A HREF="../src/HTInet.html">HTGetTmpFileName()</A>
    as described in
    <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib-bugs/msg00247.html">this
    bug report</A>. This affects also the
    <A HREF="../src/HTCache.html">HTCache</A> module which relies on temporary
    file names
  <LI>
    Made the <A HREF="../src/HTCache.html">persistent cache</A> more robust which
    in some cases will save a segmentation fault
  <LI>
    Fixed problem in <A HREF="../src/sysdep.html">sysdep.h</A> as reported in
    <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib-bugs/msg00249.html">this
    bug report</A>
  <LI>
    Fixed problem where a request was not flushed if using blocking sockets as
    reported by
    <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib-bugs/msg00250.html">this
    bug report</A>.
  <LI>
    A limitation in the current persistent cache is that it only works in
    non-preemptive mode. Hence if using blocking sockets then the cache should
    be disabled. This is now the default behavior in the
    <A HREF="../src/HTProfil.html">libwww profiles</A>.
  <LI>
    Bug fixed that caused the <CODE>maxsock</CODE> variable used in
    <CODE>select()</CODE> not to be decreased when deleting a socket in the default
    <A HREF="../src/HTEvtLst.html">event manager</A>
  <LI>
    Changed the connection management so that it complies with the
    <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-connection-00.txt">Connection
    Management</A> draft by Jim Gettys and Alan Freier. The HTTP client now closes
    idle connections after 60 seconds which is a heuristic period chosen by Jeff
    Mogul in the paper
    "<A HREF="http://www.research.digital.com/wrl/techreports/abstracts/95.4.html">The
    Case for Persistent-Connection HTTP</A>". The number can be dynamically changed
    using the <CODE>HTHost_setPersistTimeout() </CODE>and the
    <CODE>HTHost_persistTimeout() </CODE>methods. This could be made more advanced
    so that we take into account any information given in the
    "<TT>Keep-Alive</TT>" header but isn't for now.
  <LI>
    Fixed a problem when a HTTP/1.1 server sent a response including a
    <TT>Connection: close</TT> header using the close of the TCP connection as
    a delimiter. This problem was pointed out in
    <A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib-bugs/msg00254.html">this
    bug report</A>
  <LI>
    Fixed security hole handling <A HREF="../src/HTTP.c">HTTP 305 proxy redirection
    codes</A>. The proxy location returned in the responses was enabled as a
    permanent proxy without any notification. The operation now requires explicit
    acknowledgement from the user
  <LI>
    Fixed potential (but small) security whole handling
    <A HREF="../src/HTRules.html">parsing a new rules file</A>. This operation
    now requires explicit acknowledgement from the user.
