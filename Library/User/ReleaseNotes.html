<H1>Library 3.1 Release Notes</H1>

This is the announcement of the second release of the Library of
Common Code from W3C. The release is called 3.1 prerelease 1 and is to
be considered as a beta version of the official release scheduled for
end of June. The code word for this release is support for remote
collaborate work where people can use HTTP and the Web as a remote
authoring environment. The purpose of this release is to build and
maintain a close loop between W3C discussion and implementation
leading up to the final 3.1 release. <P>

In addition to the new set of features and functionality this release
also is the first example of source code distributed under the W3C
conditions. This means that the code is available to consortium
members only within a month from the release date. <P>

Due to the limited distribution of the source code it is only
available from our <A HREF="../../../Dist/">HTTP server</A> and NOT
our FTP server. There is a new "<A HREF="Using/">User's Guide</A>" on
how to use the Library as a basic tool for Web applications and as
usual, we also have a "<A HREF="Guide/">Internals and Programmer's
Guide</A>". <P>

The Library is now under <A HREF="../../COPYRIGHT.html">MIT
copyright</A> and another new formality is that everybody who makes
modifications, contributions etc. and wishes to incorporate them as
part of the W3C software distribution <A
HREF="../../PATCHES.html">must sign a form</A> that gives MIT the
permissions to use the contributions under the terms of the W3C
software distribution. <P>

<H2>Library 3.1pre2 Release Notes, July 1</H2>

This is the announcement of the second release of the Library of
Common Code from W3C. The release is called 3.1 prerelease 2 and is to
be considered as a beta version of the official version 3.1. This
prerelease is also the last one before the "real thing" which will be
out shortly after this. As usual, the release is ONLY available to W3C
members, and it not be public available until one month from now. <P>

The code word for the 3.1 release is support for remote collaborate
work where people can use HTTP and the Web as a remote authoring
environment. The reason for the slight delay is that this release has
a new "Post Web" model for implementing PUT and POST, the
documentation has been reorganized and rewritten, and some other
important features have been incorporated. The Post Web model is
described in the new documentation, see the reference below. <P>

The functionality of the Library is now almost at the planned level
for release 3.1, what we still need approximately a week for is to
integrate the Windows NT port which has kept Charlie Brooks
(cbrooks@osf.org) very busy - thanks! <P>

In addition to the new set of features and functionality this release
also is the first example of source code distributed under the W3C
conditions. This means that the code is available to consortium
members only within a month from the release date. <P>

A lot of the work put into this release has been to update the API of
the Library. This is mainly described in the new "User Guide", so
please do read this and remember that comments are welcome! <P>

<H3>New Features and Interfaces</H3>

<UL>

<LI>The Post Web model is supported by the following methods to handle
the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAccess.html#z1">HTRequest
structure</A>

<UL>
<LI>HTRequest_removeDestination()
<LI>HTRequest_linkDestination()
<LI>HTRequest_unlinkDestination()
<LI>HTRequest_removePostWeb()
<LI>HTRequest_killPostWeb()
</UL>

<LI><A HREF="../Implementation/HTFile.html">HTFile module</A> is
completely rewritten as a state machine much like the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTTP.html">HTTP module</A>. It is now
possible to have non-blocking, interruptible I/O and to PUT and POTS
from a local file as well as from a remote HTTP server.

<LI>HTCopyAnchor is rewritten to use the PostWeb

<LI>The thread model is extended to include a HTThread_kill() function
so that threads are terminated immediately upon request

<LI><A HREF="../Implementation/HTProxy.html">HTProxy module</A> is
introduced. This module substitutes the environment variables for
defining gateways and proxies. It can now be done dynamically at run
time. For backwards compatibility HTProxy_getEnvVar() can be used to
read the most used environment variables.

<LI>Taken socket read/write functionality out of HTFormat and created
<A HREF="../Implementation/HTSocket.html">HTSocket module</A> which
handles all the basic network access

<LI>Spawned <A HREF="../Implementation/HTMethod.html">HTMethod
module</A> from HTAccess module

<LI>Better handling of WAIS src files and use of gateway information

<LI>Upgraded the WAIS to handle version 0.5 of the freeWAIS Library.

<LI>Better handling of media types from WAIS responses (guessing)

<LI>All HTTP headers can now be transmitted and received and they can
all be enabled/disabled using a bitmask.

<LI>New functions to support accept encoding, language, and charset

<LI>Guess stream now handles macbinhex format

<LI>No more circular references in any of the Library include files

<LI>Introduced REMOVE and RMDIR as macros instead of direct system calls

<LI>Removed HTRequest_clear() - it's not safe to reuse a request structure!

<LI>HTStrip() is now placed in the HTString module

<LI>introducing the method used in the link structure in the anchor

<LI>HTTP modified to support PostWeb

</UL>

<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Cache is now avoided if in secure mode (no access to local file system)

<LI>Bug fix to allow simultaneous read and write on the same socket

<LI>Stream stack now dumps to local file if no conversion can be made

<LI>Bug fix that caused core dumps for HTTP 0.9 servers

<LI>Bug fixed in stream stack if system() call is not present. This
release has a new model called "Post Web" for handling put and post
from a source to a multiple number of destinations. Furthermore
</UL>

<H2>Library 3.1pre1 Release Notes, May 20</H2>

A lot of the work put into this release has been to update the API of
the Library. This is mainly described in the new "User Guide", so
please do read this and remember that comments are welcome!

<H3>New Features and Interfaces</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Windows NT Support (and possibly Windows 3.1 with Win32S) thanks
to Charlie Brooks, &lt;cbrooks@osf.org&gt;

<LI>A lot easier handling of headers in the HTTP module including
support for extra headers

<LI>Improved <A HREF="../Implementation/HTMIME.html">HTTP/MIME
parser</A> which recognizes 99% of the HTTP headers The rest will be
ready in the next release! This includes support for "charset" and
"level" parameter

<LI>Support for PUT and POST. This is not yet fully implemented but it
is possible to experiment with it

<LI>Big enhancement of the anchor module with support for all HTTP/1.0
headers, garbage collection etc.

<LI>The Cache manager is made more object oriented with a broader set
of methods. The garbage collector is not the best

<LI>HTBind module created for better bindings to file system with new
hash function for improved speed and more functionality than before

<LI>Created HTDateTimeStr() and HTMessageID() in <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTString.html">HTString</A>

<LI>Separated HTStructured into its own stream definition module (<A
HREF="../Implementation/HTStruct.html">HTStruct.h</A>)

<LI>Introduced STREAM_TRACE and BIND_TRACE as new debug flag

<LI>Original reason messages are now passed back as a parameter by the
error handler when talking to a remote HTTP server

<LI>Introduction of error_format in the request structure. This can be
used to get debug information out of the Library

<LI>Better handling of media types in FTP and Gopher including
recognition of UU encoded files
</UL>

<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Eventloop responds now faster on events as it more often does a select

<LI>HTTP version strings are now string and not floats

<LI>Many platform dependent macros introduced and a lot of cleanup
</UL>
