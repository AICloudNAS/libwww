<P>
This release is the first release after the <A HREF="../cvs.html">libwww
CVS Repository</A> was made public in May 1998. At the time of the release
there were more than 500 checked out versions of the libwww code base and
numerous people have contributed to this release in form of
<A HREF="../Collaborators.html">bug fixes, extensions, and new features</A>.

  New Features
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTAccess.c?r1=1.145&amp;r2=1.146">Added
    a method</A> in the <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">HTAccess API</A> for posting
    forms and returning the response as a <A HREF="../src/HTChunk.html">HTChunk
    object</A>
  <LI>
    Added handler for unknown content encodings in the
    <A HREF="../../ComLine/">Command Line tool</A> to be a through line (identity
    decoding) using the <A HREF="#bestmatch">best matching mechanism</A>
  <LI>
    Added support for <A HREF="../src/HTProxy.html">regex handling of proxies</A>
    so that you can now say something like this: all URIs matching this regex
    goes to this proxy, all others go to this, etc.
  <LI>
    Better control of how much data is being sent in the
    <A HREF="../src/HTReq.html" REQUEST OBJECT &lt; / A>. Now you can both get
    the total number of bytes read and written as well as the number of entity
    (body) bytes read and written. This uses features provided by the HTNet object
    </A>
  <LI>
    The default implementation of <A HREF="../src/HTDialog.c">progress
    notifications</A> now uses the new HTRequest bytes read/written methods.
  <LI>
    The mime parser in <A HREF="../src/HTMIME.c">HTMIME.c</A> and
    <A HREF="../src/HTMIMERq.c">HTMIMERq.c</A> now uses the updated control of
    bytes read/written.
  <LI>
    Added support for version conflict detection in <A HREF="../../WinCom/">Web
    Commander</A> (update all of WinCom area)
  <LI>
    The <A HREF="../../WinCom/">Web Commander</A> - the Win32 GUI PUT sample
    application has been updated from the ground up - try it out!

  Bug Fixes

<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTAccess.c?r1=1.144&amp;r2=1.145">Remove
    access authentication credentials</A> duplicates when doing the HTSaveFilter
    on the same resource
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTAnchor.c?r1=1.77&amp;r2=1.78">Checks
    that etags are not the same when setting a new one</A>. This caused first
    the old (which was also the new) to be deleted and then created again.
  <LI>
    Fixed HTTP POST problem where small post data didn't always get posted. This
    affects several files including
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTMIME.c?r1=2.88&amp;r2=2.89">HTMIME.c</A>
    and

    <A HREF="../../src/HTFilter.c">HTFilter.c</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTFile.c?r1=1.146&amp;r2=1.147">The
    last modified time is now stored in the anchor object when opening a local
    file</A>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTAccess.c?r1=1.143&amp;r2=1.144">Added

  <LI>
    Made <TT>WWW_TraceFlag</TT> unsigned integer in
    <A HREF="../src/HTUtils.html">HTUtils.html</A> (was signed) and changed order
    in wwwsys.html so that netinet/in.h now is included before netinet/tcp.h
    in wwwsys.html. This was a problem on RC6000.
  <LI>
    Put in a few checks for invalid function arguments (NULL etc.) in
    <A HREF="../src/HTEscape.c">HTEscape.c</A> and
    <A HREF="../src/HTParse.c">HTParse.c</A>

  <LI>
    Changed the <A NAME="bestmatch" HREF="../src/HTFormat.html#encoding">encoding
    streamstack builder</A> to support <EM>best matching</EM> (wildcard matching)
    capabilities. This means that you now can register a default decoder like
    this: <CODE>HTFormat_addCoding("*", HTIdentityCoding, HTIdentityCoding,
    0.3)</CODE>, for example where <CODE>HTIdentityCoding</CODE> is a coder provided
    by libwww. The quality indicates how much you like it (between 0.0 and 1.0)
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTProxy.c?r1=2.15&amp;r2=2.16">Now

    (a little),
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTAlert.html?r1=2.51&amp;r2=2.52">HTAlert.html</A>

  <LI>
    Moved the increment of bytes written (used in PUT) from the
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTBufWrt.c?r1=2.21&amp;r2=2.22">buffered
    output steam </A>to the
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTWriter.c?r1=2.50&amp;r2=2.51">unbuffered
    output stream</A> which gives a more accurate reading.
  <LI>
    Bad typo bug when deleting before filters in
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTNet.c?r1=2.93&amp;r2=2.94">HTNetCall_addBefore</A>
    which caused deletion problems in the Filter list
  <LI>

    in the
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTAccess.c?r1=1.142&amp;r2=1.143">Save
    Filter</A>. The cleanup is now made more cleanly.
  <LI>
    Moved the <B>Done!</B> progress notification into
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTMIME.c?r1=2.87&amp;r2=2.88">HTMIME.c</A>
    instead of in
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTReader.c?r1=2.24&amp;r2=2.25">HTReader.c</A>
    as it no longer has much to do with closing the TCP connection.
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTChannl.c?r1=2.17&amp;r2=2.18">Made

	NAME="Auth1">Fixed problem in the template generation in the access
    authentication module</A>. This can cause the authentication module to not
    find the credentials already given.
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/libwww/Library/src/HTHost.c?r1=2.46&amp;r2=2.47">Fixed
    strange deletion of semaphore control for non-persistent connections</A>
  <LI>
    A close socket event wasn't registered on Windows. This is now done in
    <A HREF="../src/HTHost.c">HTHost.c</A>.
  <LI>
    On some platforms, it is not possible to refer to function addresses across
    shared libraries. The result is that the libwww API that uses function addresses
    don't always work. I have added an opcode version of the
    <A HREF="../src/HTAlert.html">HTAlert API</A> to handle this for user messages
    and progress notifications.
