  Library 4.1 Release Notes
</H1>
<H2>
  Release 4.1b1 May 20 1996
</H2>
<H3>
  New Features
</H3>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Introduced GNU autoconf configure script for compiling on Unix platforms
    instead of the old BUILD script. This should make it a lot easier to compile
    on Unix as we get all the advantages of GNU autoconf.
  <LI>
    Introduction of the <A HREF="../src/HTUser.html">HTUserprofile Class </A>which
    keeps track of a "user" known to the Library
  <LI>
    New access authentication interface allowing for dynamic registration of
    new access authentication mechanisms. It provides an easy API for hooking
    in new schemes.
  <LI>
    Improved handling of trace messages which allows for easy redirection of
    trace messages
  <LI>
    Support for registration of content coders/decoders and content transfer
    encoders/decoders. This is done the same way as for media types by registering
    a set of streams that can handle the various encodings.
  <LI>
    Support for <I>chunked</I> decoding
  <LI>
    Introduction of the <A HREF="../src/HTHost.html">HTHost Class</A> which keeps
    track of information about remote hosts
  <LI>
    The <A HREF="../src/HTDNS.html">DNS Class</A> has been simplified to handle
    DNS queries only. All additional information about the remote host is defined
    by the HThost Class.
  <LI>
    We have a new <A HREF="../src/HTEvent.html">HTEvent module</A> which allows
    for dynamic registration of an event manager. This will make it much easier
    to use external event managers together with libwww. If you wish to continue
    to use the event loop from HTEvntrg, you must register it explicitly with
    <A HREF="../src/HTEvent.c">HTEventInit</A>. To activate this event loop
    (currently only necessary in MSWindows), you must call
    <A HREF="../src/HTEvntrg.html">HTEventrgInit</A>. Both of these calls are
    demonstrated in <A HREF="../../LineMode/src/HTBrowse.c">HTBrowse</A>.
  <LI>
    The <A HREF="../src/HTStream.html">HTStream module</A> has been created
    containing a set of basiv streams such as an error stream etc.
  <LI>
    Introduction of the <A HREF="../src/HTTrans.html">HTTransport Class</A>.
    This allows for dynamic registration of transport protocols such as for example
    the W3Mux protocol, TCP access, local file access etc.
  <LI>
    All MIME parsing is now done with registered parsers. The
    <A HREF="../src/HTMIME.html">HTMIME</A> module only unwraps the &nbsp;MIME
    header fields and calls the best parser. The header parsing origonally done
    in HTMIME can be found in <A HREF="../src/HTInit.c">HTInit.c</A> and is
    registered with <A HREF="../src/HTInit.html">HTMIMEInit</A>.

  Bug Fixes

<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    A host name is not expanded to a fully qualified domain name as it is not
    reliable enough
