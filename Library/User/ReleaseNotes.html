<h2><a name="5.3.1">Release 5.3.1, Aug 4, 2000</a></h2>

<p>This is the proper first 5.3 release. We changed the minor release number
as many people had started to refer to the previous release as 5.3.0.</p>
<ul>What's new
    <li>Changed the Makefile so that .html-&gt;.h file conversion will only be
      done with Perl. This is faster than using the www tool.</li>
    <li>Updated the latest autoconf, automake, and libtools scripts. Now using
      the separate <a
      href="http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/config/">config.guess
      and config.sub</a> scripts.</li>
    <li>Extended the libwww/SSL API with HTSSL_setProtocol () and
      HTSSL_verifyDepth () functions to allow to change the TSL/SSL default
      protocol and the certificate verification depth. The wwwssl application
      was updated accordingly.</li>
    <li>Diverse documentation updates provided by Fox One.</li>
  </ul>
<ul>Fixed bugs
    <li>The www wasn't able to convert .html files into .h ones anymore.</li>
    <li>the <a href="Extrnals.html">Extrnals.html</a> file wasn't being
      generated on all platforms.</li>
    <li>Applied diverse patches for libwww/SSL which should correct the
      multiple request and Post problems that people had signaled. Many thanks
      to Heiner Kallweit and Gertjan van Winger for their contributions.</li>
    <li>Other patches I (unfortunately) forgot to note down and am too lazy to
      get them out from CVS... (sorry, will keep better notes next time!)</li>
</ul>

<ul>Outstanding bugs
    <li>Interpretation of <a
      href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-lib/2000JulSep/0050.html">FD_CLOSE</a>
      under Windows.</li>
    <li>The FTP implementation has memory leaks and doesn't remember the path
      or authentication information correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="5.3.0pre">Release 5.3.0pre, Jun 9, 2000</a></h2>

<p>This is the first release done after Henrik's depart from W3C. We're
calling it a pre-release, as we're not sure if we prepared it correctly.
Special thanks to Henrik Frystik, Fox One, Vladimir Koslov, Rafaelle Sena, and
all the other libwww User's Community for their patches and continuous
support.</p>
<ul>
  What's new
    <li>Included all the patches commited to CVS since the last release. It's
      been over a year since the last release and we don't have an exact count
      of what was commited. Many of them consisted of memory leak fixes and
      fixup with the asynchronous event handlers and timers under Win32.</li>
    <li>Integrated the libwww-SSL code back into libwww (the US export
      restriction doesn't apply anymore to source code).</li>
    <li>Upgraded expat to v1.1.</li>
    <li>Merged the outstanding Amaya libwww changes into the main tree.</li>
</ul>
