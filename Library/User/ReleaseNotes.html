  Library 4.1 Release Notes
</H1>
<P>
The focus for version 4.1 of the <A HREF="../">W3C Reference Library</A>
is to provide a set of higher level, application specific APIs for accessing
the Web. These APIs - called <A HREF="../src/HTProfil.html">profiles</A>
- will help the application, a W3b client for example, to more easily use
the full potential of the application independent Library core. Also, the
Library contains a significantly better interface for easy access to the
Web through a <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">large set of functions</A>
specialized to perform certain Web operations like <CODE>PUT</CODE>,
<CODE>POST</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, <CODE>GET</CODE> and
<CODE>HEAD</CODE>.
<H2>
  Release 4.1b3 July 20 1996
</H2>
<P>
This release contains a <A HREF="../../Robot/">TCL add-on to the Robot
</A>example application and a <A HREF="../Test/User/">Deja GNU Test suite</A>
for the Library. Also, it support <A HREF="../../Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</A>
including persistent connections, two-way <CODE>PUT</CODE>, and the
<CODE>host</CODE> header. There is also a sample <A HREF="../src/HTPEP.c">PEP
implementation</A>, that although incomplete can give an idea of where we're
headed using PEP.
<P>
The file access module now does content negotiation by default. This means
that all local file access (including from client applications) do content
negotiation when accessing local files. Content negotiation can be turned
off by setting a flag in the request object
<P>
Other new features and changes
<UL>
  <LI>
    Introduced <A HREF="../src/HTUser.html">HTUserprofile</A> class to handle
    host and user specific information
  <LI>
    A host name is not expanded to a <B>fqdn</B> name as it is not reliable enough
  <LI>
    Updated <A HREF="../src/HTML.html">HTML parser</A> to support
    <CODE>BASE</CODE> tag and <CODE>LINK</CODE> tag
  <LI>
    Added new access methods to the <A HREF="../src/HTAccess.html">HTAccess
    module</A>. It is now part of the <A HREF="../src/WWWApp.html">WWWApp
    interface</A>
  <LI>
    Updated the <A HREF="../src/HTIcons.html">Icon module</A> and added icons
    to the distribution file
  <LI>
    Added a <A HREF="../src/HTSChunk.html">Stream to Chunk converter </A>for
    easier conversion of streams into dynamic memory buffers
  <LI>
    Introduced <A HREF="../src/HTLib.html">HTLib</A> as a new core module. It
    contains generic information about the core which used to be in the HTAccess
    module.
  <LI>
    Added support for <A HREF="../../Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</A>
  <LI>
    Fixed problem in the rule file parser. It didn't parse the last line of the
    config file
  <LI>
    Added <A HREF="../src/HTTChunk.html">Chunked decoding and encoding module</A>
</UL>
<H2>
  Release 4.1b1 May 20 1996
</H2>
<H3>
  New Features
</H3>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Introduced GNU autoconf configure script for compiling on Unix platforms
    instead of the old BUILD script. This should make it a lot easier to compile
    on Unix as we get all the advantages of GNU autoconf.
  <LI>
    Introduction of the <A HREF="../src/HTUser.html">HTUserprofile Class </A>which
    keeps track of a "user" known to the Library
  <LI>
    New access authentication interface allowing for dynamic registration of
    new access authentication mechanisms. It provides an easy API for hooking
    in new schemes.
  <LI>
    Improved handling of trace messages which allows for easy redirection of
    trace messages
  <LI>
    Support for registration of content coders/decoders and content transfer
    encoders/decoders. This is done the same way as for media types by registering
    a set of streams that can handle the various encodings.
  <LI>
    Support for <I>chunked</I> decoding
  <LI>
    Introduction of the <A HREF="../src/HTHost.html">HTHost Class</A> which keeps
    track of information about remote hosts
  <LI>
    The <A HREF="../src/HTDNS.html">DNS Class</A> has been simplified to handle
    DNS queries only. All additional information about the remote host is defined
    by the HThost Class.
  <LI>
    We have a new <A HREF="../src/HTEvent.html">HTEvent module</A> which allows
    for dynamic registration of an event manager. This will make it much easier
    to use external event managers together with libwww. If you wish to continue
    to use the event loop from HTEvntrg, you must register it explicitly with
    <A HREF="../src/HTEvntrg.html">HTEventrgInit</A>. This call is demonstrated
    in <A HREF="../../LineMode/src/HTBrowse.c">HTBrowse</A>.
  <LI>
    The <A HREF="../src/HTStream.html">HTStream module</A> has been created
    containing a set of basiv streams such as an error stream etc.
  <LI>
    Introduction of the <A HREF="../src/HTTrans.html">HTTransport Class</A>.
    This allows for dynamic registration of transport protocols such as for example
    the W3Mux protocol, TCP access, local file access etc.
  <LI>
    All MIME parsing is now done with registered parsers. The
    <A HREF="../src/HTMIME.html">HTMIME</A> module only unwraps the &nbsp;MIME
    header fields and calls the best parser. The header parsing origonally done
    in HTMIME can be found in <A HREF="../src/HTInit.c">HTInit.c</A> and is
    registered with <A HREF="../src/HTInit.html">HTMIMEInit</A>. This call is
    demonstrated in <A HREF="../../LineMode/src/HTBrowse.c">HTBrowse</A>.

    A host name is not expanded to a fully qualified domain name as it is not
    reliable enough
