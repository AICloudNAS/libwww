  TODO-List for W3C Sample Code Library
</H1>
<P>
This is the current work plan for new features and changed interfaces for
libwww. You can also have a look at <A HREF="ReleaseNotes.html">release
notes</A> for the latest release and the <A HREF="History.html">change
history</A> for older releases.
<P>
We are moving to the Java platform pretty soon but some of the stuff that
we have in mind are
<DL>
  <DT>
    Enhanced PEP Implementation
  <DD>
    The current PEP Implementation does not contain all the features described
    in the latest draft
  <DT>
    Byte range requests
  <DD>
    This is a "poor man's:" multiplexing but with better semantic understanding
    of what is going on as it is handled in application space
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../../Protocols/MUX/">MUX</A> Implementation
  <DD>
    The MUX Implementation is being worked on. We need to get some performance
    figures for how it performs.
