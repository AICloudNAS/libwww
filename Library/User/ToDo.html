  TODO-List for W3C Reference Library
</H1>
<P>
This is the current work plan for new features and changed interfaces for
the W3C Referene Library.

  <DT>
    Memory Resource Handler - <I>done</I>
  <DD>
    The Library needs a mechanism to allow to get around situations when memory
    is exhausted.
  <DT>
    Better debug and trace messages facilities - <I>done</I>
  <DD>
    Currently all debug messages are included in all versions of the Library.
    In order to distinguish between debug versions and release versions, the
    debug messages should only be included in the debug version.
  <DT>
    Experimenting with HTTP protocol implementations including HTTP/1.x, PEP
    and <A HREF="../../Protocols/HTTP-NG/">HTTP-NG</A> - <I>halfway</I>
  <DD>
    An important part of the W3C software is to provide reference implementations
    of the Web protocols. The next release will provide important new features
    in this area.
  <DT>
    Integration with <A HREF="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">ILU</A>
    from Xerox Parc - <I>starting</I>
  <DD>
    Integrating ILU and libwww is part of the experiments with HTTP-NG and it
    also allows for better integration between various programming languages.
