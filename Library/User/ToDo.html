<H1>Working List for the Library</H1>

This is a list of what's going on in the Library of Common Code. It
also is a strong indication of what's going on in the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>.


<H2>Plan for Next release</H2>

These topics have been implemented and are under test or they are very
close to be so. Anyway, you will find it in the next release! You can
also look at the <A HREF="../Features/Features.html">Change
History</A> to see what's new in the current version.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP/1.0</A> Compilant <A
HREF="../Features/HTTPFeatures.html">HTTP module</A>

<DD>An improved HTTP module that supports (almost) all HTTP/1.0
features as currently specified.

<DT><A HREF="../../User/Features/HTTPPost.html">PUT and POST</A>

<DD>Support for <B>PUT</B> and <B>POST</B> in Library (should have
been there a long time ago). This is going to use the multithreaded
model which already works for <B>GET</B> and <B>HEAD</B>. It enables
the possibility of editing and saving a document to a remote HTTP
server and to copy a document from one remote HTTP server to another.

<DT>HTTP/MIME-parser

<DD> A new HTTP/MIME-parser that can be used as a general module. A new
MIME parser has been implemented. It understands all <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP headers</A> and stores <EM>entity</EM>
information in the anchor structure. Request relevant information is
stored in the request structure. See <A HREF="../Guide/">Programmer's
Guide</A> for more information.

<DT>Content Length Counter Stream

<DD>Which is needed for PUT and POST

<DT>Windows NT

<DD>Better support for Windows is under test

<DT>Other

<DD>A bunch or minor things...

</DL>


<H2>Under Development</H2>

These topics are under development but might not get into the next
release:

<DL>

<DT>A better API

<DD>Many people say that the Library is too hard to use...

<DT>Typed Links

<DD>This should also have been there a long time ago, but now we want
it!

<DT>Better support for <B>Accept</B> headers and other headers

<DD>Including Accept-Language, etc.

<DT>Expires, Last-Modified etc.

<DD>As we have a better MIME parser, we can now implement all these
nifty features

<DT>New News Module

<DD>A better News module which also supports PUT and POST.

<DT>Full editing capabilities with versioning

<DD>So that we can do PUT and POST to a remote server

</DL>

<H2>Next Week's Working Plan</H2>

This is what we <B>are going to</B> implement. If somebody should get
the idea of writing some of the modules mentioned, it will be
appreciated a lot ;-).  Contact <I>libwww@w3.org</I> for further
coordination.

<DL>

<DT>Access Authentication

<DD>Support for various schemes as they pop up (which they tend to do
quite a lot these days)

<DT>Keep-Alive

<DD>Implement support for <EM>KEEP-ALIVE</EM> requests where the
client can <B>GET</B>, <B>PUT</B>, and <B>POST</B> several documents
over the same line - all using non-blocking I/O

<DT>Whois++

<DD> Actually a WhoIs++ module has been implemented (thanks to Michael
Mealling, ccoprmm@oit.gatech.edu) in the library but it is not in this
release as I haven't found many WhoIs++ servers and that the port
chosen is 43 just like the old WhoIs protocol, and that makes it a bit
tricky.

<DT>README File in directory listings

<DD>Make it possible to have both Ascii files (using
&lt;PRE&gt;...&lt;/PRE&gt;) and HTML files.

<DT>Non-blocking DNS interface

<DD>Does anyone know of a public domain non-blocking DNS interface to
make smart <B>getXbyY()</B> function calls?

<DT>OS/2 listings

<DD>Implement long FTP directory listings for OS/2 platforms.

</DL>


<H2>Ideas for New Features</H2>

This is what we <B>have not started yet</B> but what we would like to
implement.

<DL>
<DT> Separation of Protocol Modules
<DD> The protocol modules should be separated completely from the HTML
     machinery so that it is possible to, e.g., get raw FTP directory listings
     through to the user.
</DL>
