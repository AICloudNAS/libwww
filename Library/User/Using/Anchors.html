  The Anchor Class
</H1>
<P>
An anchor represents a region of a hypertext document which is linked to
another anchor in the same or a different document. Another name for anchors
would be URLs as an anchor represents all we know about a URL - including
where it points to and who points to it.&nbsp;Because the anchor objects
represent the part of the Web, the application has been in touch, it is often
useful to maintain the anchors throughout the lifetime of the application.
It would actually be most useful if we had persistent anchors so that an
application could build up a higher knowledge about the Web topology.
