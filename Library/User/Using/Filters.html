  Before and After Filters
</H1>
<P>
Until now we have not mentioned a lot about what the Library actually can
do. The fact is that the core part of libwww actually doesn't do much. All
the functionality must be registered by the application - in orther words
- the application programmer builds a libwww profile for an application by
registrering a specific set of protocol modules, callbacks and filters.
<H2>
  Use the Standard Filters
</H2>
<P>
The libwww distribution package somes with a large set of
<A HREF="../src/HTFilter.html">standard filters</A>. These are filters that
can be used in most applications and will do 80% of the job. The standard
filters cover the following functions
<P>
Proxy and Gateway redirection
<P>
Memory and Persistent cache
<P>
Rule Files
<P>
Logging
<P>
Error Message Generation
<P>
Redirection
<P>
Authentication
<H2>
  Where the Standard Filters Aren't Enough
</H2>
<P>
In some situations, you can not use the standard filters
<H2>
  Write you own Filters
</H2>
<P>
A great way extending the fucntionallity of your application is to write
a new filter that can either be hooked in globally or locally depending on
its nature.
