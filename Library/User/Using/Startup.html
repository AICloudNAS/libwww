<H1>Getting Started</H1>

The Library distribution package can be obtained from the <A
HREF="../../">Library status page</A> and it includes all source files
and some <A HREF="../../../README.html">README</A> files describing
what the package contains. There is also an online "<A
HREF="../Installation.html">Installation Guide</A>" explaining how to
unpack and compile the Library. As new versions of the Library are
released frequently, it is recommended that you verify that the
version is up to date by looking into the "Version.Make" file in the
"Implementation" directory of the Library and compare it with the
information given at the <A HREF="../../">Library status page</A>.<P>

From version 3.0, the include file "<A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A>" is the only
include file which is required in order to use the Library.  This file
contains all the functionality that is publicly available, but as the
architecture is currently very exposed, this includes most of the
modules in the Library itself.  Apart from this, only two functions
are necessary in order to initialize and cleanup the Library
respectively:

<DL>

<DT><CODE>BOOL HTLibInit()</CODE>

<DD>This function initializes memory, file descriptors, interrupt
handlers etc. By default it also calls initialization functions for
all the dynamic modules in the Library. The dynamic modules are
described in "<A HREF="../Architecture/DesignModel.html">Libwww
Architecture</A>". A major part of the User's Guide is to describe how
the Library can be configured, both at run time and at compile time,
and the dynamic modules are an important part of the Library
configuration.

<DT><CODE>BOOL HTLibTerminate()</CODE>

<DD>Cleans up the memory and closes open file descriptors.

</DL>

It is essential that <CODE>HTLibInit()</CODE> is the first call to the
Library and <CODE>HTLibTerminate()</CODE> is the last as the behavior
otherwise is undefined. As an example, a minimal application will look
like this:

<PRE>
	#include &lt;WWWLib.h>
	/* Other initializations */

	int main()
	{
		HTLibInit();

		/* Application stuff */

		HTLibTerminate();
		return 0;
	}
</PRE>
