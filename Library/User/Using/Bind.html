<H1>Bindings to the local File system</H1>

Client applications have access to the local filesystem using
<EM>file</EM> URLs and server applications has inherently a close
connection to the local file system from which it is serving files to
the requesting parties. The binding betweeen a file and its
representation internally in the Library, that is the content-type,
natural language, and encoding is maintained by the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTBind.html">HTBind module</A>. The current
implementation of this module bases the binding on file suffixes, but
the module is separated so that other kind of bindings can be
implemented, for example using a database. The set of suffix
delimiters is normally a function of the current platform, but can at
any time be modified, so that for example the characters ".", "_", and
"+" can be defined as delimiters. </P>


As for the converters and presenters, the Library has a default set of
bindings between media types and file name extensions but the
difference is that the bindings are initialized at start up time in
the <CODE>HTLibInit()</CODE> function, and hence does not have to be
done explicitly by the application.  However, new bindings can be set
up using the methods:</P>

<PRE>
	HTBind_setType()
	HTBind_setEncoding()
	HTBind_setLanguage()
</PRE>

If the Library is to handle a file that is not described by
the binding rules, it reads the first part of the data object and try
and guess the media type. This is an internal operation in the Library
and does not require any interaction with the application.</P>
