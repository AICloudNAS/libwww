  Getting Libwww from the CVS Repository
</H1>
<P>
Using <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">CVS</A> allows you to
follow the development of libwww closely and to contribute much easier. The
following requires that you are familiar with CVS - if not then look at
<A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/info.html">Cyclic's pages on CVS</A> or
the <A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs-index.html">excellent
information</A> provided by
<A HREF="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/">Pascal.Molli</A>.
<H2>
  Libwww Releases
</H2>
<P>
First of all, using CVS allows you to use the very latest version of libwww
- as soon as a fix or a new feature is commit'ed to the CVS repository then
you can update your working version and you will have it right away.
<P>
The purpose of "releases" is to say that now we believe that the code is
stable with a well defined set of features. Until now, we have been giving
out distribution files every time we announced a release. This will not change,
but you can use the CVS repository in exactly the same way - often with much
less overhead than dealing with a distribution package.
<P>
Every release is marked in the CVS repository using tags, so that it is possible
to retrieve a complete release using the CVS <CODE>-r </CODE>option (note
that <CODE>-r</CODE> is "sticky"). Check out the online
<A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/">CVS log walker</A> for the current
set of release tags. We were less strict tagging all the files in early releases
so don't go too far back in the past if you expect to be able to compile
the code!
<H2>
  Anonymous CVS Checkout
</H2>
<P>
This is read-only access which means that you can check out the code but
not commit any changes. However, it allows you to make up-to-date patches
which are much easier for the libwww maintainers to integrate. The instructions
should work for both <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/unix.html">Unix</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/windows.html">Windows</A>. Before
you can check out the sources, you need to be running CVS 1.9 or later, and
login by running the following command:
<PRE>% <B>cvs -d</B> <B>:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public login</B>
</PRE>
<P>
after which you type "<STRONG>anonymous</STRONG>" as password. To get the
latest version from the CVS repository, run this command:
<PRE>% <B>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public -z3 checkout libwww</B>
</PRE>
<P>
After which you will get all the code coming at you, you'd better have at
least 10MBytes available on your machine. If you want to get a specific release
using CVS tags then you need to add a <CODE>-r</CODE> option, for example
<PRE>% <B>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public -z3 -r Release-5-1m checkout libwww</B>
</PRE>
<P>
Check the <A HREF="http://dev.w3.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/">CVS log walker</A>
for the current set of release tags.
<H2>
  SSH Based CVS Checkout
</H2>
<P>
This is read/write access to the CVS repository which means that you must
have SSH access to the repository. You setup CVS to using SSH as remote shell
by setting the <CODE>CVS_RSH</CODE> env variable. Using bash, it looks like
this:
<PRE>% <B>export CVS_RSH=/usr/local/bin/ssh</B>
</PRE>
<P>
When you are using SSH, you don't need to do a CVS login. Instead you can
just go ahead checking out libwww like this
<PRE>% <B>cvs -d dev.w3.org:/sources/public checkout libwww</B>
</PRE>
<P>
Again, if you want a specific revision then use something like this
<PRE>% <B>cvs -d dev.w3.org:/sources/public -r Release-5-1m checkout libwww</B>
</PRE>
<P>

<A HREF="http://dev.apache.org/nt-cvs-ssh.txt">special notes on how to use
SSH for Windows</A>.

  Getting Bootstrapped
</H2>
<P>
When you get libwww from CVS there are some files (header files and make
files) that have to be generated before you can compile it.
<H3>
  Unix
</H3>
<P>
On Unix, these files are generated by software that you MUST have on your
platform - luckily they are all free! The list is
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/index.html">GNU automake</A>
  <DD>
    Automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in's which are used
    by autoconf
  <DT>
    <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">GNU autoconf</A>
  <DD>
    A tool for automatically generating Makefile's which are used by make
  <DT>
    <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html">GNU libtool</A>
  <DD>
    A tool for automatically handling generation of shared libraries
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../LineMode/">W3C www</A>
  <DD>
    Out own Line Mode Browser. If you don't already have it then you have to
    download a <A HREF="Distribution.html">wrapped up distribution package</A>
    and compile it from there
</DL>
<P>
I also <B>strongly</B> recommend that you are using
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">GCC</A>. Many OS specific
make's don't have the libwww make files.
<P>
After having checked out the libwww code, you should now run the following
two commands
<PRE>% <B>automake</B>
% <B>autoconf</B>
</PRE>
<H3>
  Windows
</H3>
<P>
On Windows, you need the following tools in order to get bootstrapped:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <A HREF="../LineMode/">W3C www</A>
  <DD>
    Out own Line Mode Browser. If you don't already have it then you have to
    download a <A HREF="Distribution.html">wrapped up distribution package</A>
    and compile it from there
</DL>
<H2>
  Compiling libwww
</H2>
<P>
Now you have a set of files equivalent to what you normally get in a distribution
file. You are now ready to <A HREF="../INSTALL.html">compile the software</A>
