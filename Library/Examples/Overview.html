  Ready to go Examples
</H1>
<P>
This is the list of small examples using the very basic features of the Library.
If you have not already compiled the library then please read the
<A HREF="../../Installation.html">Installation guide</A> before you continue.
If you want more details of how to use the Library then please read the
<A HREF="../User/Using/">User's Guide</A>.
<P>
In the example we assume that the compiler knows where to look for the Library
include file <CODE>WWWLib.h</CODE> and also knows where to find the binary
library, often called <CODE>libwww.a</CODE> on Unix platforms and
<CODE>libwww.lib</CODE> on Windows. Again, the result might depend on the
setup of the dynamic modules, but if no dynamic modules are enabled then
the example will generate an executable file. If you are in doubt about how
to set your compiler then you can often get some good ideas by looking into
the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>. &nbsp;If you are
using the GNU autoconf configure script then the examples are built as part
of the overall package. On other platforms, you must provide the make file
on your own.
<P>
Some platforms require a socket library when building network applications.
This is for example the case when building on Macintosh or Windows machines.
The Library uses the
<A HREF="http://err.ethz.ch/members/neeri/macintosh/gusiman/GUSI.html">GUSI
socket</A> library on the Macintosh and the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.spry.com/ms-windows/winsock/docs/winsock.txt">WinSock
library</A> on windows platforms. Please check the documentation on these
libraries for how to install them and also if there are any specific requirements
on your platform when building network applications.

    <A HREF="libapp_1.c">Start and Stop the Library</A>
  <DD>
    This is a dummy program that just initializes as terminates the Library
  <DT>
    <A HREF="init.c">Default Initialization of libwww</A>
  <DD>
    This example shows how to set up all the default handlers, parsers, converters,
    etc. using the <A HREF="../src/WWWInit.html">WWWInit interface</A>.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="libapp_2.c">Specialized Initialization of libwww</A>
  <DD>
    This example show how to register a protocol module and a stream converter
  <DT>
    <A HREF="head.c">Issue a HEAD request</A>
  <DD>
    This small example sets up a request and performs a HEAD method on the URL
    given on the command line
  <DT>
    <A HREF="chunk.c">Load a Document into Memory</A>
  <DD>
    A simple example of how you can create a memory buffer containing the contents
    of the URL <I>and</I> all the protocol headers.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="chunkbody.c">Load a Document into Memory</A>
  <DD>
    This program shows how to load a URL into memory <I>without</I> getting the
    header information.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="libapp_3.c">Load a URL and counnt the number of bytes in the body</A>
  <DD>
    This is an example of how you can add streams and then get the desired result.
    The example shows how to add a content length counter stream and get the
    result back.
  <DT>
    <A HREF="libapp_4.c">Load a URL to local File without Asking for a File
    Name</A>
  <DD>
    We here show how to fetch a URL using HTTP and to save it to local file.
    You must specify a local file name on the command line.

<P>
You can also have a look at the more
<A HREF="../User/Applications.html">complete example applications</A> which
are capable of doing more interesting things. If you have any example code
that you would like to <A HREF="../../PATCHES.html">share with us </A>then
please send us a mail so that we can add it to this page.
