<H1>Ready to go Examples</H1>

This is the list of small examples using the very basic features of the Library. If you have not
already compiled the library then please read the <A HREF="../Installation.html">Installation
guide</A> before you continue. If you want more details of how to use the Library then please read
the <A HREF="../User/Using/">User's Guide</A>. <P>

In the example we assume that the compiler knows where to look for the Library include file
<CODE>WWWLib.h</CODE> and also knows where to find the binary library, often called
<CODE>libwww.a</CODE> on Unix platforms and <CODE>libwww.lib</CODE> on Windows. Again, the result
might depend on the setup of the dynamic modules, but if no dynamic modules are enabled then the
example will generate an executable file. If you are in doubt about how to set your compiler then
you can often get some good ideas by looking into the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode
Browser</A>. If you are on a Unix box then you can probably use this <A HREF="Makefile">makefile</A>
by typing:

<PRE>
	setenv WWW_MACH &lt;your platform&gt;
	cd WWW/Library/Examples
	make
</PRE>

where your platform is one of the names corresponding to a directory in the <A HREF="../../All/">All
directory</A>. Some platforms require a socket library when building network applications. This is
for example the case when building on Macintosh or Windows machines. The Library uses the <A
HREF="http://err.ethz.ch/members/neeri/macintosh/gusiman/GUSI.html">GUSI socket</A> library on the
Macintosh and the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.spry.com/ms-windows/winsock/docs/winsock.txt">WinSock
library</A> on windows platforms. Please check the documentation on these libraries for how to
install them and also if there are any specific requirements on your platform when building network
applications.<P>

<DD>This is a dummy program that just initializes as terminates the Library

<DD>This example show how to register a protocol module and a stream converter

<DT><B><A HREF="libapp_3.c">Fetching a URL interactively</A></B>
<DD>We here show how to fetch a URL using HTTP and to save it to local file. We also prompt the user
for a file name for the local file.

<DT><B><A HREF="libapp_4.c">Fetching a URL non-interactively</A></B>
<DD>We here show how to fetch a URL using HTTP and to save it to local file. You must specify a local
file name on the command line.
