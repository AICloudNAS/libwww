  Running the Function Testing
</H1>
<P>
Basically, we're using the standard Dejagnu setup. At first, I had compile
expect in and was more or less scripting some sort of testing, but I realized
that wasn't the way to go. As glue code is not the best means of showing
data structures, a number of tests are some what crippled by this.
<P>
As dejagnu is concerned, having the newest Tcl 7.5 installed causes problems.
So, I'd recommend getting the most recent version of dejagnu and installing
it instead. However, here is the basic rundown:

  <LI>
    Compile the WWW Reference Library and wwwtest
  <LI>
    Download dejagnu and follow the compiling/installation instructions.
  <LI>
    Link the dejagnu-?.? directory to Library/Test/
  <LI>
    Link the wwwtest binary into the Library/Test/
  <LI>
    Make sure the TCL_LIBRARY variable points to the dejagnu's version of Tcl.
    (dejagnu/tcl/library)
  <LI>
    Run make check.
</OL>
<P>
If you want to specify a module, edit the makefile and replace the TEST_FILES
variable to the specific script.
