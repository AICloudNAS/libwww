<PRE><P>
	(c) COPYRIGHT MIT 1995.
	Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.
</PRE><P>This is the README file which you get when you unwrap one of our distribution files. Each package
contains source code for building one or more of our Web applications and related helper
applications. The set of W3C Web applications is currently:
<UL><LI><A HREF="Library/">Reference Library (libwww)</A>
<LI><A HREF="LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>
<LI><A HREF="ComLine/">Command Line Tool</A>
<LI><A HREF="MiniServ/">Mini Server</A>
<LI><A HREF="Robot/">Mini Robot</A>
<LI><A HREF="Listen/">Socket Listen Tool</A>
</UL><P>Please note that the W3C Reference Library distribution file is required
in order to build any of
the other applications. At the bottom of this file, you will find pointers
to more information about
each application.

<H2>Handling the Distribution Files
</H2><P>A distribution file contains the source code for one or more of the
modules. W3C also provides a set
of precompiled binaries which are available for W3C members
<A HREF="../Dist/">directly via HTTP</A>
or as public domain via anonymous FTP from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/">ftp.w3.org</A>.
<P>

All distribution files are available as compressed tar files, gzipped tar
files, or as zip
files. For the compressed tar files, first uncompress and untar the file
<CODE>&lt;dist&gt;.tar.Z</CODE> where <CODE>&lt;dist&gt;</CODE> is the name
of the specific
distribution:

<PRE><P>
	uncompress &lt;dist&gt;.tar.Z

	gunzip &lt;dist&gt;.tar.gz
</PRE><P>Then untar the file by typing

<PRE><P>
	tar xf &lt;dist&gt;.tar
</PRE><P>For the zip files, type the following:

<PRE><P>
	unzip &lt;dist&gt;.zip
</PRE><H2>Compilation
</H2><P>Compilation can be put into two groups depending on your platform
and if it is supported in the
BUILD script or not. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script is placed in the
<CODE>WWW</CODE> directory and you
can use it to compile and link the W3C applications. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script
figures out what
platform you are on and generates a <CODE>Makefile</CODE> which consists
of a platform independent
part and a platform dependent part.

<H3>Compilation on already supported Unix platforms
</H3><P><IMG SRC="Icons/32x32/caution.gif" ALT="Note">Stop here and take
a look at
the <A HREF="Library/User/Patch/Overview.html">patches</A> &nbsp;to see if
you have to apply any source code patches
<P>

We use autoconf in order to compile the reference source code on Unix platforms.
Please read the <A HREF="INSTALL.html">INSTALL</A> document for instructions.
<H3>Compilation on un-supported Unix platforms
</H3><P>For other Unix platforms please read the guide on how to
<A
HREF="Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">adjust the BUILD script</A> for
compilation on your
platform.

<H3>Compilation on Windows
</H3><P>For Windows we have some
<A HREF="Library/User/Platform/Windows.html">special documentation</A> on
how you can produce DLLs out of the Reference Library.

<H2>Reference Library (libwww)
</H2><P>The W3C Reference Library is a general code base that can be used
to build clients and servers. It
contains code for accessing HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers,
and the local file
system. Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting
hypertext objects to
the user and a wide spectra of generic programming utilities. The Library
is the basis for many <A
HREF="TheProject.html">World-Wide Web</A> applications and all the W3C software
is build on top of
it. The Library is a required part of all other W3C applications in this
distribution.
<P>

The Library documentation is included in the distribution file and you can
find the top page at

<PRE><P>
	Library/User/Overview.html
</PRE><P>You can also use the <A HREF="Library/">online documentation</A>

<H2>Line Mode Browser
</H2><P>The W3C Line Mode Browser is a simple character based client. It
is developed for use on dumb
terminals and as a test tool for the Common Code Library. It can be run in
interactive mode, non-
interactive mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety of
possibilities for data
format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool
for quick access to the
Web or used in batch jobs.
<P>

Installation is very simple as the application can run without any particular
setup. You can specify
your own <EM>HOME PAGE</EM> using the <CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> environment variable.
Remember toy setup
a <CODE>NNTPSERVER</CODE> environment variable before you try to access a
news server.
<P>

The Line Mode Browser documentation is included in the distribution file
and you can find the top
page at

<PRE><P>

<H2>Mini Server
</H2><P>The W3C Mini Server is a cross platform server frame work that can
be used as a basis for writing
portable servers. It is <B>NOT</B> a full server - only a frame! It is developed
in C and serves as
an example of a server application using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Reference
Library</A>.

<H2>Command Line Tool
</H2><P>The W3C Command Line Tool is a cross platform command line tool for
accessing the Web. It is
developed in C and serves as an example of a client application using the
<A HREF="../Library/">W3C
Reference Library</A> and as a test-tool for quick access to the Web from
scripts, cron jobs etc. It
gives a variety of possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc.
It is primarily intended
as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or used in scripts, cron jobs
etc.

<A HREF="../Library/">W3C Reference
Library</A> and as a test-tool for quick access to the Web from scripts,
cron jobs etc. It is
primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or used in
scripts, cron jobs etc.

<H2>Socket Listen Tool</H2>

The W3C Socket Listen Tool is a cross platform tool for debugging what
is being sent over the wire. It simply listens on a socket and
forwards everything to stderr or whatever is available on the actual
platform. It is developed in C and serves as an example application
using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Reference Library</A><P>
