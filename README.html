<H1>W3C Source Code Distribution Packages</H1>

<HR>

<PRE>
	(c) COPYRIGHT MIT 1995.
	Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.
</PRE>

This is the README file which you get when you unwrap one of our tar files. The package contains
source code for building World-Wide Web applications and related reference applications. In its full
contents it contains the source code for the following modules:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Library/">W3C Reference Library</A>
<LI><A HREF="Daemon/">W3C httpd</A>
<LI><A HREF="LineMode/">W3C Line Mode Browser</A>
<LI><A HREF="ComLine/">W3C Command Line Tool</A>
<LI><A HREF="MiniServ/">W3C Mini Server Frame</A>
</UL>

At the bottom of this file, you will find pointers to more information.

<H2>Handling the Distribution Files</H2>

All distribution files contain the source code for each of the modules. W3C also provides a wide set
of precompiled binaries which are available for W3C members <A HREF="../Dist/">directly via HTTP</A>
or as public domain via anonymous FTP from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/">ftp.w3.org</A>.<P>

All of the distribution packets are available as compressed or gzipped tar files, and some are also
available as zip files. For the compressed tar files, first uncompress and untar the file
<CODE>&lt;dist&gt;.tar.Z</CODE> where <CODE>&lt;dist&gt;</CODE> is the name of the specific
distribution:

<PRE>
	uncompress &lt;dist&gt;.tar.Z

	gunzip &lt;dist&gt;.tar.gz
</PRE>

Then untar the file by typing

<PRE>
	tar xf &lt;dist&gt;.tar
</PRE>

For the zip files, type the following:

<PRE>
	unzip &lt;dist&gt;.zip
</PRE>


<A NAME="dirstruc"><H2>Generated Directory structure</H2></A>

The tar files are all designed to be unwrapped in the same (this) directory. They create different
parts of a common directory tree under that directory. There may be some duplication. They also
generate a few files in this directory: README, COPYRIGH, and some installation instructions. The
structure of the untar'ed package is as follows (directories):

<PRE>
	WWW				Top-node

	WWW/All/*/Makefile.include	Platform dependent make files

@	WWW/Library			W3C Reference Library
	WWW/Library/Implementation	Source Code
	WWW/Library/User		Documentation

</PRE>

"<CODE>@</CODE>" means that eaach of these modules are given out as a <EM>separate distribution
file</EM>.  Some or more of these directories might not be there. This depends on the number of
distribution files. In general there is one distribution file pr. module (Library, Line Mode
Browser, and Daemon). Please note that the Library distribution file is required for all other
modules.

<H2>Compilation</H2>

Compilation can be put into two groups depending on if the platform is supported in the BUILD script
or not. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script is placed in the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory and you can use it to
compile and link the W3C applications. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script figures out what platform you are
on and generates a <CODE>Makefile</CODE> which consists of a platform independent part and a
platform dependent part.

<H3>Compilation on already supported Unix platforms</H3>

To <CODE>BUILD</CODE> any of the applications go to the WWW directory
and type

<PRE>
	./BUILD library

	./BUILD daemon

	./BUILD linemode

	./BUILD comline

	./BUILD miniserv
</PRE>

or simply 

<PRE>
	./BUILD
</PRE>

in order to BUILD all applications

<H3>Compilation on un-supported Unix platforms</H3>

For other Unix platforms please read the guide on how to <A
HREF="Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">adjust the BUILD script</A> for compilation on your
platform.

<H3>Compilation on Windows</H3>

For Windows we have some <A HREF="Library/User/Platform/Windows.html">special documentation</A> on
how you can produce DLLs out of the Reference Library

<H2>W3C Reference Library</H2>

The W3C Reference Library is a general code base that can be used to build clients and servers. It
contains code for accessing HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local file
system. Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and presenting hypertext objects to
the user and a wide spectra of generic programming utilities. The Library is the basis for many <A
HREF="TheProject.html">World-Wide Web</A> applications and all the W3C software is build on top of
it. The Library is a required part of all other W3C applications in this distribution. <P>

The Library documentation is included in the distribution file and you can find the top page at

<PRE>
	Library/User/Overview.html
</PRE>

You can also use the <A HREF="Library/">online documentation</A>

<H2>W3C httpd</H2>

W3C httpd is a generic public domain full-featured hypertext server which can be used as a regular
HTTP server. The running typically on port 80 to serve hypertext and other documents, and also as a
proxy -- a server on a firewall machine -- that provides access for people inside a firewall to the
outside world. When running as proxy httpd may be configured to do caching of documents resulting in
faster response times. <P>

Follow instructions above for compiling and then go on to "<A
HREF="Daemon/User/Installation/Installation.html"> Installing the basic W3 server</A>". You can also
use the <A HREF="Daemon/">online documentation</A>

<H2>Places to contact</H2>

If you encounter problems, would like to feed back suggestions good ideas etc. then please contact
the following addresses:

<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A></B> regarding the W3C Reference Library,
Command Line Tool, and the Mini Server.
<LI><B><A HREF="mailto:httpd@w3.org">httpd@w3.org</A></B> regarding the W3C httpd
<LI><B><A HREF="mailto:www-bug@w3.org">www-bug@w3.org</A></B> regarding the W3C Line Mode Browser
</UL>

<H2>W3C LineMode Browser</H2>

The W3C Line Mode Browser is a character based World-Wide Web Browser.  It is developed for use on
dumb terminals and as a test tool for the Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode,
non- interactive mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a variety of possibilities for
data format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to
the Web or used in batch jobs.<P>

Installation is very simple as the application can run without any particular setup. You can specify
your own <EM>HOME PAGE</EM> using the <CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> environment variable. Remember toy setup
a <CODE>NNTPSERVER</CODE> environment variable before you try to access a news server. <P>

The Line Mode Browser documentation is included in the distribution file and you can find the top
page at

<PRE>
	LineMode/Defaults/Overview.html
</PRE>

You can also use the <A HREF="LineMode/">online documentation</A>

<H2>W3C Mini Server</H2>

The W3C Mini Server is a cross platform server frame work that can be used as a basis for writing
portable servers. It is <B>NOT</B> a full server - only a frame! It is developed in C and serves as
an example of a server application using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Reference Library</A>.<P>

The Mini Server documentation is included in the distribution file and you can find the top page at

<PRE>
	MiniServ/User/
</PRE>

You can also use the <A HREF="LineMode/">online documentation</A>

<H2>W3C Command Line Tool</H2>

The W3C Command Line Tool is a cross platform command line tool for accessing the Web. It is
developed in C and serves as an example of a client application using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C
Reference Library</A> and as a test-tool for quick access to the Web from scripts, cron jobs etc. It
gives a variety of possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily intended
as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or used in scripts, cron jobs etc.<P>

The Command Line Tool documentation is included in the distribution file and you can find the top
page at

<PRE>
	ComLine/Defaults/Overview.html
