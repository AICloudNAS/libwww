<H1>World-Wide Web CERN-distributed code</H1>

<HR>

<PRE>
	(c) COPYRIGHT CERN 1994.
	Please first read the full copyright statement in the file COPYRIGH.
</PRE>

This is the README file which you get when you unwrap one of our tar
files. The package contains source code for building World-Wide Web
applications and related reference applications. In its full contents
it contains the source code for the following modules:

<UL>
<LI>Library of Common Code
<LI>CERN HTTPD
<LI>CERN Line Mode Browser
<LI>CERN Next Browser/Editor
</UL>

<H2>Handling the Distribution Files</H2>

These distribution files contains source code. CERN also provides a
wide set of precompiled binaries which are available from via
anonymous FTP from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.w3.org/">ftp.w3.org</A> or
directly via HTTP from the status page mentioned under each
module. <P>

First uncompress and untar the file <CODE>&lt;dist.tar.Z&gt;</CODE> is
the specific distribution file:

<PRE>
	uncompress &lt;dist.tar.Z&gt;
</PRE>

Then untar the file by typing

<PRE>
	tar xf &lt;dist.tar&gt;
</PRE>

<H2>Generated Directory structure</H2>

The tar files are all designed to be unwrapped in the same (this)
directory. They create different parts of a common directory tree
under that directory. There may be some duplication. They also
generate a few files in this directory: README, COPYRIGH, and some
installation instructions. The structure of the untar'ed package is as
follows (directories):

<PRE>
	WWW				Top-node

	WWW/All				Platform dependent make files

	WWW/Library			Library of Common Code
	WWW/Library/Implementation	Source Code
	WWW/Library/*			Platform dependent object files

	WWW/Daemon			CERN HTTPD
	WWW/Daemon/Implementation	Source Code
	WWW/Daemon/*			Platform dependent object files

	WWW/LineMode			CERN LineMode Browser
	WWW/LineMode/Implementation	Source Code
	WWW/LineMode/*			Platform dependent object files

	WWW/Next			CERN Next Browser/Editor
	WWW/Next/Implementation		Source Code
	WWW/Next/*			Platform dependent object files
</PRE>

Some or more of these directories might not be there. This depends on
the number of distribution files. In general there is one distribution
file pr. module (Library, LineMode Browser, and Daemon). The Library
distribution file is required for all the other module.

<H2>Compilation</H2>

Compilation can be put into two groups depending on if the platform is
supported in the BUILD script or not. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script is
placed in the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory and you can use it to compile
and link the W3C applications. The <EM>BUILD</EM> script figures out
what platform you are on and generates a <CODE>Makefile</CODE> which
consists of a platform independent part and a platform dependent part.

<H3>Compilation on already supported platforms</H3>

To <CODE>BUILD</CODE> any of the applications go to the WWW directory
and type

<PRE>
	./BUILD library

	./BUILD daemon

	./BUILD linemode
</PRE>

or simply 

<PRE>
	./BUILD
</PRE>

in order to BUILD all applications

<H3>Compilation on Non-Supported Platforms</H3>

This will require some more work, but please read the online
documentation at <A
HREF="WWW/Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Platform/Porting.html</A>


<H2>Library of Common Code</H2>

The CERN World-Wide Web Library of Common Code is a general code base
that can be used to build clients and servers. It contains code for
accessing HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News, WAIS, Telnet servers, and the local
file system. Furthermore it provides modules for parsing, managing and
presenting hypertext objects to the user and a wide spectra of generic
programming utilities. The Library is the basis for many <A
HREF="WWW/TheProject.html">World-Wide Web</A> applications and all the
CERN WWW software is build on top of it. The Library is a required
part of all other CERN WWW applications in this distribution. <P>

Online documentation is available <A HREF="WWW/Library/Status.html">
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Library/Status.html</A>. If you don't
have a WWW client then telnet to <CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid
or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.

<H2>LineMode Browser</H2>

The CERN Line Mode Browser is a character based World-Wide Web
Browser.  It is developed for use on dumb terminals and as a test tool
for the CERN Common Code Library. It can be run in interactive mode,
non- interactive mode and as a proxy client. Furthermore it gives a
variety of possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc. It
is primarily intended as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or
used in batch jobs.<P>

Installation is very simple as the application can run without any
particular seup. You can specify your own <EM>HOME PAGE</EM> using the
<CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> environment variable. Remember toy setup a
<CODE>NNTPSERVER</CODE> environment variable before you try to access
a news server. <P>

Online documentation is available <A HREF="WWW/LineMode/Status.html">
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Status.html</A>. If you don't
have a WWW client then telnet to <CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid
or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.

<H2>Server</H2>

CERN httpd is a generic public domain full-featured hypertext server
which can be used as a regular HTTP server. The running typically on
port 80 to serve hypertext and other documents, and also as a proxy --
a server on a firewall machine -- that provides access for people
inside a firewall to the outside world. When running as proxy httpd
may be configured to do caching of documents resulting in faster
response times. <P>

Follow instructions above for compiling and then go on to "<A
NAME="z9" HREF="WWW/Daemon/User/Installation.html"> Installing the
basic W3 server</A>". <P>

Online documentation is available <A HREF="WWW/Daemon/Status.html">
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html</A>. If you don't
have a WWW client then telnet to <CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid
or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.

<H2>NeXTStep Browser/Editor</H2>

The browser for the NeXT is those files contained in the application
directory WWW/Next/Implementation/WorldWideWeb.app and is
compiled. When you install the app, you may want to configure the
default page, WorldWideWeb.app/default.html. These must point to some
useful information! You should keep it up to date with pointers to
info on your site and elsewhere. If you use the CERN home page note
there is a link at the bottom to the master copy on our server. You
should set up the address of your local news server with

<PRE>
	dwrite WorldWideWeb NewsHost news
</PRE>

replacing the last word with the actual address of your news host.
See <A NAME="6" HREF="WWW/NeXT/Installation.html">Installation
instructions</A>. <P>

Online documentation is available <A HREF="WWW/Next/Status.html">
http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Next/Status.html</A>. If you don't
have a WWW client then telnet to <CODE>telnet.w3.org</CODE> (no userid
or password required) and you will get the Line Mode Browser.

<H2>Places to contact</H2>

If you encounter problems, would like to feed back suggestions good
ideas etc. then please contact the following addresses:

<UL>
<LI><B>libwww@info.cern.ch</B> regarding the Library of Common Code
<LI><B>httpd@info.cern.ch</B> regarding the CERN HTTPD

<H2>General</H2>

Your comments will of course be most appreciated, on code, or
information on the web which is out of date or misleading. If you
write your own hypertext and make it available by anonymous ftp or
using a server, tell us and we'll put some pointers to it in
ours. Thus spreads the web... <P>

<EM>Have fun!</EM>
