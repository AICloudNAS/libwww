 Welcome to the libwww! You have just unpacked one of our distribution files
 and can find the contents in the <CODE>w3c-libwww-x.x </CODE>directory where
 <CODE>x.x </CODE>indicates the version. Please read the
 <A HREF="README.html">README</A> file in this directory for details on how
 to go on from here. The README file gives you information about what each
 distribution file contains and what you need in order to compile and build
 one or more of the applications. You can find the complete W3C software
 distribution at
 <PRE>	http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Distribution.html
 </PRE>
 <P>
 All our software distribution packages contain documentation written in HTML.
 You can therefore use your favorite browser to browse through the documentation
 locally so that you do not need to use the network. Please read the README
 file in each of the application directories in order to find the top page
 of the documentation for each module. For example, the README file for the
 W3C Sample Code Library can be found in
 <P>
 <PRE>	w3c-libwww-x.x/Library/README
 </PRE>
 <P>
 If you do not have a browser then please continue and build the Line Mode
 Browser (www) which you can find in the directory
 <PRE>
 	w3c-libwww-x.x/LineMode
 </PRE>
 <P>
 If you can not find this directory then please download the Line Mode Browser
 distribution file from
 <PRE>
 	http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/LineMode/
 </PRE>
 <P>
 or by using anonymous FTP to
 <CODE><A HREF="ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/">ftp.w3.org</A></CODE>. When the Line
 Mode Browser is built then you can use this application to browse through
 the documentation.
 <P>
 If you encounter problems or would like to feed back suggestions, good ideas
 etc. then please send a mail to
 <A HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A> noting the version of the
 distribution files that you are using.
