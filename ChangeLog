	* The cache garbage collector (HTCacheGarbage()) could go into an
	  endless loop when it tried to removed locked entries. The problem
	  was that it wasn't checking the return code of HTCache_remove().

	* Changed the macro argument from "data" to "dp" in 
	  HTArray_firstObject() and HTArray_nextObject(). These macros
	  are defined such that if the caller doesn't pass in a variable
	  named exactly "data" as the second parameter, there will either be a
	  syntax error generated during the compilation OR the wrong structure 
	  element will get referenced.  This is because the macro argument 
	  "data" was the same name as the HTArray structure element that was
	  being referenced in the macro.
