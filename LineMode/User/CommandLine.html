<H1>Command Line Syntax</H1>

The syntax is:

<PRE>
	www [<A HREF="#z19" NAME="z20">options</A> ]  [<A HREF="#z16"NAME="z14"> docaddress</A> [<A HREF="#z17" NAME="z18"> keywords</A> ]]
</PRE>

With no arguments, and if the <A HREF="../Status.html" >Line Mode
Browser</A> has not been <A HREF="Customisation.html">customized</A>
then it automaticly tries the following locations:

<OL>
<LI>~/WWW/default.html
<LI>/usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html
<LI>http://www.w3.org/default.html
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="z19">Options</A></H2>

Options should be specified before other arguments. Currently
available options are:-

<H3>Main Modes of execution</H3>

<DL>

<DT>-

<DD>A minus sign with no trailing characters indicates that the
program will accept<A HREF="../../MarkUp/MarkUp.html"> HTML format</A>
input from the standard input. This allows www to be used as a filter
from html to plain text for example. Relative links in the input are
parsed as though the address of the document was that of the home page
(or docaddress if specified). Implies non-interactive mode.

<DT>-h host

<DD>Establish a telnet connection to the remote host specified. This
implies a "secure mode" execution where all references to the local
file system are canceled.

<DT>-m <A HREF="../../Protocols/HTTP/Methods.html">&lt;METHOD&gt;</A>

<DD>This mode gives the possibility of setting the Method of the HTTP
request. The default value is <B>GET</B>. The current supported values
are:

<UL>
<LI>get
<LI>head
</UL>

This option implies non-interactive execution.

<DT>-n

<DD>Non-interactive mode. Outputs the formatted document to the
standard output, then exits. Pages are delimited with form feed (FF)
characters.

<DT>-single

<DD>Singlethreaded mode. If this flag is set then the browser uses
blocking, non interruptible I/O in interactive mode. Non-interactive
mode always uses blocking I/O.

<DT>-v

<DD>Verbose mode: Gives a running commentary on the program's attempts
to read data in various ways. This can also be turned on and off
during normal execution, see <A HREF="Commands.html"
NAME="z21">Existing Commands</A>. As the amount of verbose output from
the Browser and the Library is substantial, the <CODE>-v</CODE> option
can now be followed by zero, one or more of the following flags in
order to differentiate the verbose output generated:

<DL>

<DT>s

<DD>Show the SGML/HTML relevant information

<DT>u

<DD>Show URI relevant information

<DT>a

<DD>Show Anchor relevant information

<DT>p

<DD>Show Protocol module information

</DL>

The <CODE>-v</CODE> option without any appended options shows all
trace messages

</DL>

<H3>Data format conversions (non-interactive)</H3>

<DL>

<DT>-from &lt;format&gt;

<DD>Only if WWW is executed as a filter, this option indicates the
desired input format according to the HTTP-specifications. The default
value is "text/html".

<DT><A NAME="z28">-reformat</A>

<DD>The output is to be in HTML, "canonicalized" so that line breaks
will be put in common places. Comments, processing instructions, etc,
will be stripped. This feature allows HTML files produced by
different editors to be compared.

<DT>-source

<DD>Display the original source (without any MIME-headers) of a
document instead of parsing it. Has effect for HTML from w3 servers,
and news articles. (v1.2a or later). In order to get the
MIME-headers, use the " -to " command.

<DT>-to &lt;format&gt;

<DD>Format is the output format for www. Default value is
"www/present" but may be changed according to the HTTP-specifications.
Two common output formats are "www/source" that is the source without
MIME-headers and "www/mime" that is the source with the MIME-header if
any. Though also "text/latex" is possible which generates a LaTeX
version of the (HTML) document. This can then be compiled using latex
and put out as Postscript.

</DL>

<H3>Other modes that force non-interactive mode</H3>

<DL>

<DT>-listrefs

<DD>Adds a list of the addresses of all documents references to the
end of the HTML file.

<DT>-o &lt;file&gt;

<DD>Redirects output to specified file.

<DT>-version

<DD>Prints out the version number of the software, and the version
number of the WWW library, and exits.</DL>

<H3>Screen options</H3>

<DL>

<DT>-p n

<DD>where n is a number, specifies the page length. Without a number,
that is <CODE>-p</CODE> without any number, makes the page length
infinite. Default page size is 24 or is automitically set on some
systems.

<DT>-w n

<DD>where n is a number, specifies the page width in columns. The
default is 78, 79 or 80 depending on the system. (v1.0 or later)

</DL>

<H3>Anchor formats</H3>

<DL>

<DT>-a &lt;format&gt;

<DD>Specifies the printf-style format string to be used when printing
references. Must contain the two characters "%d" where the numbers
should occur. Be sure to escape or quote any special characters you
use. For example under Unix:

<DT>-na

<DD>Hides anchor positions in the text. Useful, when printing out the
document. The option can also be used together with the
<CODE>-p</CODE> option with no number specified (infinite page
length).

</DL>

<H3>Directory Listings</H3>

<DL>

<DT>-d &lt;options&gt;

<DD>The <CODE>-d</CODE> directive can be used to modify the directory
listing layout. More than one option can be specified but they might
be mutually exclusive. The following options are available:

<DL>

<DT>t

<DD>Place any readme file at the top of the list (default)

<DT>b

<DD>Place any readme file at the bottom of the list

<DT>r

<DD>Ignore any readme file

<DT>n

<DD>Directory listings are not allowed

<DT>s

<DD>Directory listings are only allowed in the directories where a
file <CODE>.www_browsable</CODE> is located. The content of the file
is of no importance.

<DT>y

<DD>Directory listings are always allowed (default)

</DL>

</DL>

<H3>Other configuration options</H3>

<DL>

<DT>-l &lt;file&gt;

<DD>Specifies a log file with a list of visited documents.

<DT>-r &lt;file&gt;

<DD>Rule file (configuration file). If this is specified, a rule file
may be used to map URLs, and to set up other aspects of the behavior
of the browser. Many rule files may be given with successive -r
options. One rule file name may be given using the WWW_CONFIG
environment variable.

<PRE>
	www -a \&lt;%d\&gt;
</PRE>

<PRE>
	www -a "(Type %d)"
</PRE>

<DD>

<DT>-cacheroot &lt;path&gt;

<DD>This option defines the root of the cache system. If the option is
not specified, no local file cache is generated. If the parameter is
specified without a path then a default cache root is set - normally
to <CODE>/tmp</CODE>.

<DT>-help or -?

<DD>Load this file from directly into the browser

</DL>

<H2><A NAME="z16">docaddress</A></H2>

If present, the next argument (docaddress) is the <A
HREF="../../Addressing/Addressing.html">hypertext address</A> , of the
document at which you want to start browsing. You may want to define
an alias for www followed by name of your favorite index. <H2><A
NAME="z17">keywords</A></H2>Any further command line arguments are
taken as keywords. The first argument must refer to an index in this
case. The index is searched for entries matching the keywords, and a
list of matching entries is displayed. <P>
