<H1>Line Mode Browser Commands</H1>

The following commands are available at the prompt within <A
HREF="../">WWW Line Mode Browser</A> when used in
interactive mode. Not all of them are applicable at all times, but the
online help shows which commands can be used at a particular
moment. All commands may be abbreviated and case is not
significant. As an example, you can type "<A HREF="#put">put</A>"
as:

<PRE>
	pu, put, Put, PUT, etc.
</PRE>

If the browser is run in "multi threaded" mode, then you can type in a
new command at all times. You do not have to wait until a command is
terminated. All requests can be interrupted by hitting 'z' (or 'Z')
and then return:

<PRE>
	<B>z</B> &lt;RETURN&gt;
</PRE>

When run in single threaded mode using the <A
HREF="CommandLine.html#single">-single</A> command line option, it is
not possible to interrupt a request.

<H3>Getting Help</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>help</B>, <B>?</B>
<DD>Gives a list of available commands depending on the context, the
version number of the www program, and the <A
HREF="../../Addressing/Addressing.html">hypertext address</A>, (or
URL) of the document you are reading.
<DT><B>manual</B>
<DD>Jumps directly to the master document of the online manual.
<DT><B>verbose</B>
<DD>Toggles verbose mode (for maintenance purposes).
</DL>

<H3>Getting around in a document</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>&lt;return&gt;</B>
<DD>Just hitting Return displays the next page (if any) of the current document.
<DT><B>top</B>, <B>bottom</B>
<DD>Goes to the top or the bottom of the current document
<DT><B>up</B>, <B>down</B>
<DD>Scrolls up or down one page in the current document.
</DL>

<H3>Load a Document</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>&lt;number&gt;</B>
<DD>Typing a number by itself follows the corresponding reference from the currently displayed document.

<DT><B>back</B>
<DD>Goes back to the document you were reading before.

<DT><B>forward</B>
<DD>Goes to the next document in the history list if any.

<DT><B>goto</B> &lt;address&gt;

<DD>Goes to the document represented by the given hypertext address,
which is interpreted relatively to the current document.

<DT><B>home</B>

<DD>Goes back to the first document you were reading.

</DL>

<H3>Search a Document</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>find</B>, <B>keyword</B> &lt;keywords&gt;

<DD> Queries the current index with the supplied keywords (separated
by blanks). The interpretation of the keywords depends on the
particular information server you're looking at. In most cases, it
will search a database for entries matching the keywords, and will
display the results with possibly links to further details. For more
complex queries, instructions should be present in the cover page. The
"Find" (or "Keywords") command can be omitted if the first keyword
does not conflict with another www command.
</DL>

<H3>Upload a Document to a remote server</H3>

In version 3.1 and later of the Line Mode Browser you can send a
document to a remote HTTP server using PUT or POST. 

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="put"><B>put</B></A>
<DD>Put a document (PUT) to remote HTTP server. You can either put a
file on your local file system, or from a remote HTTP server. An example is:

<PRE>
	put
	Source: http://www.w3.org
	Destination: http://www.my.server
</PRE>

<DT><A NAME="post"><B>post</B></A>
<DD>Post a document (POST) to remote HTTP server. As for PUT you can
either post a file on your local file system, or from a remote HTTP
server. The syntax is the same as for PUT.

</DL>

<H3>Killer Features</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>clear</B>

<DD>Clears the history list

<DT><B>list</B>

<DD>Gives a numbered list of the links from the current document,
giving the title of the target documents if it is known otherwise the
URL To follow a link, type the number by itself as above. By using <A
NAME="z9" HREF="#z11">source</A>, only the URL's are displayed.

<DT><B>quit</B>, <B>exit</B>
<DD>Leaves the application.

<DT><B>recall</B> [ n ]
<DD>Without a parameter (n), "recall" gives a numbered list of the
documents you have visited.  To select one, type "recall" followed by
the number.

<DT><B>refresh</B>
<DD>Refresh the screen

<DT><B>reload</B>
<DD>Forces a full reload of the document regardless of whether the
object might already be in either the memory cache or in the local
file cache.

<DT><A NAME="z11"><B>source</B></A>

<DD> Followed by another command, causes raw source to be generated
for that command but without any MIME headers wrapped around it. This
is useful for printing postscript files without formatting, with
SOURCE PRINT.

</DL>

<H3>On Unix versions, the following extra commands are available:</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>print</B>

<DD> Prints the current document, without the numbered document
references.  A background www is launched to do that, and its output
is piped to the command defined by the environment variable
WWW_PRINT_COMMAND ("lpr" by default). Can be used with <A NAME="z12"
HREF="#z11">source</A> .

<DT><B>&gt;</B> &lt;file&gt;

<DD> Saves the current document to the given file, without the
numbered document references. A background www is launched to do
that. If the file exists, a ">!" will overwrite it. Can be used with
<A NAME="z13" HREF="#z11">source</A> .

<DT><B>&gt;&gt;</B> &lt;file&gt;

<DD> Appends the current document to the given file without the
numbered links. Can be used with <A NAME="z14" HREF="#z11">source</A>.

<DT><B>|</B> &lt;command&gt;

<DD>Pipes the current document to the given command, without the
numbered document references. A background www is launched to do
that. Can be used with <A NAME="z15" HREF="#z11">source</A> .

<DT><B>!</B> &lt;command&gt;

<DD>Executes the given shell command without leaving www.

<DT><B>cd</B>, <B>lcd</B> &lt;directory&gt;

<DD>Changes the local working directory. "! cd directory" won't do
this because it applies to a subshell.
