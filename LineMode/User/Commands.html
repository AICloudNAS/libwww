<H1>Line Mode Browser Commands</H1>

The following commands are available at the prompt within <A
HREF="../Status.html">WWW Line Mode Browser</A>. Some are disabled
when not applicable. All commands may be abbreviated. Case is not
significant.

<H3>Getting Help</H3>
<DL>

<DT>Help, ?</A>

<DD>Gives a list of available commands depending on the context, the
version number of the www program, and the<A
HREF="../../Addressing/Addressing.html"> hypertext address</A>, (or
UDI) of the document you are reading.

<DT>Manual

<DD>Jumps directly to the master document of the online manual.

</DL>

<H3>Getting around in a document</H3>

<DL>

<DT>&lt;Return&gt;

<DD> Just hitting Return displays the next page (if any) of the
current document.

<DT>Top, Bottom

<DD>Goes to the top or the bottom of the current document

<DT>Up, Down

<DD>Scrolls up or down one page in the current document.

</DL>

<H3>Load a document</H3>

In version 3.0 and later of the Line Mode Browser you can immediately
type another command as soon as the prompt line returns. This is the
result of the multithreaded model used in the <A
HREF="../../Library/Status.html">Library of Common Code</A>. You don't
have to wait until the down load or upload has finished.

<DL>
<DT>&lt;number&gt;

<DD>Typing a number by itself follows the corresponding reference from
the currently displayed document.

<DT>Back

<DD>Goes back to the document you were reading before.

<DT>Next, Previous

<DD>Goes to the next or previous document in the list of pointers from
the document that led to the current one. This is better explained
with an example: suppose you are reading a document which looks like a
menu, and you want to read all entries in turn. You first type "1" to
read the first referred document (by following the first link), and
then you type "next" or just "n" to read the next one from the menu,
without actually coming back to the menu and typing "2", etc.

<DT>Go &lt;address&gt;

<DD>Goes to the document represented by the given hypertext address,
which is interpreted relatively to the current document.

<DT>Home

<DD>Goes back to the first document you were reading.

<DT>Find, Keywords &lt;keywords&gt;

<DD> Queries the current index with the supplied keywords (separated
by blanks). The interpretation of the keywords depends on the
particular information server you're looking at. In most cases, it
will search a database for entries matching the keywords, and will
display the results with possibly links to further details. For more
complex queries, instructions should be present in the cover page. The
"Find" (or "Keywords") command can be omitted if the first keyword
does not conflict with another www command.

</DL>

<H3>Upload a document to a remote server</H3>

In version 3.1 and later of the Line Mode Browser you can send a
document to a remote HTTP server using PUT or POST. 

<DL>
<DT>copy

<DD>Copy a document (PUT) to remote HTTP server. You can either copy a
file on your local file system, or from a remote HTTP server. An example is:

<PRE>
	copy
	Source: http://www.w3.org
	Destination: http://www.my.server
</PRE>

</DL>

<H3>Interrupt Current Requests</H3>

Both uploads and downloads can be interrupted at any time.

<DL>

<DT>z, Z

<DD>If running in multithreaded mode (default in interactive mode from
version 3.0), you can interrupt a request by typing 'z'.

</DL>

<H3>Other Features</H3>

<DL>

<DT>List

<DD> Gives a numbered list of the links from the current document,
giving the title of the target documents if it is known otherwise the
URL To follow a link, type the number by itself as above. By using <A
NAME="z9" HREF="#z11">source</A>, only the URL's are displayed.

<DT>Recall

<DD> Without a parameter, gives a numbered list of the documents you
have visited.  To select one, type "Recall" followed by the number.

<DT><A NAME="z11">Source</A>

<DD> Followed by another command, causes raw source to be generated
for that command but without any MIME headers wrapped around it. This
is useful for printing postscript files without formatting, with
SOURCE PRINT.

<DT>Verbose

<DD> Toggles verbose mode (for maintenance purposes).

</DL>

<H3>Exit World Wide Web</H3>

<DL>

<DT>Quit, Exit

<DD> Leaves the application.

</DL>

<H3>On Unix versions, the following extra commands are available:</H3>

<DL>

<DT>Print

<DD> Prints the current document, without the numbered document
references.  A background www is launched to do that, and its output
is piped to the command defined by the environment variable
WWW_PRINT_COMMAND ("lpr" by default). Can be used with <A NAME="z12"
HREF="#z11">source</A> .

<DT>&gt; file

<DD> Saves the current document to the given file, without the
numbered document references. A background www is launched to do
that. If the file exists, a ">!" will overwrite it. Can be used with
<A NAME="z13" HREF="#z11">source</A> .

<DT>&gt;&gt; file

<DD> Appends the current document to the given file without the
numbered links. Can be used with <A NAME="z14" HREF="#z11">source</A>.

<DT>| command

<DD>Pipes the current document to the given command, without the
numbered document references. A background www is launched to do
that. Can be used with <A NAME="z15" HREF="#z11">source</A> .

<DT>! command

<DD>Executes the given shell command without leaving www.

<DT>CD (or LCD) directory

<DD> Changes the local working directory. "! cd directory" won't do
this because it applies to a subshell.
