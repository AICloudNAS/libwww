<H1>Line Mode Browser 3.1 Release Notes</H1>

This is the announcement of the first release of the Line Mode Browser
from W3C. The release is called 3.1 prerelease 1 and is to be
considered as a beta version of the official release scheduled for
June. The code word for the June release is support for remote
collaborate work where people can use HTTP and the Web as a remote
authoring environment. The purpose of this release is to build and
maintain a close loop between W3C discussion and implementation
leading up to the final 3.1 June release. <P>

Due to the limited distribution of the source code it is only
available from our <A HREF="../../../Dist/">HTTP server</A> and NOT
our FTP server. There is a "<A HREF="QuickGuide.html">User's Guide</A>" on
how to use the Line Mode Browser as a basic tool for Web
applications.<P>

The Line Mode Browser is now under <A HREF="../../COPYRIGHT.html">MIT
copyright</A> and another new formality is that everybody who makes
modifications, contributions etc. and wishes to incorporate them as
part of the W3C software distribution <A
HREF="../../PATCHES.html">must sign a form</A> that gives MIT the
permissions to use the contributions under the terms of the W3C
software distribution. <P>
