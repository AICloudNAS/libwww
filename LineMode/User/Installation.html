<H1>Installation Guide</H1>

<HR>

This section describes how to install the World-Wide Web <A
HREF="../">Line Mode Browser</A> called "www".

<H2>Getting the Program</H2>

Often you don't need to compile the browser yourself, precompiled
binaries are available for many Unix platforms.  If there is no
precompiled version for your platform, of if it doesn't work (e.g. the
name resolution doesn't work), you should get the source code and
compile it yourself. There are <A HREF="Installation_VMS.html">special
instructions for VMS</A> if you are <A
HREF="http://delonline.cern.ch/disk$user/duns/doc/vms/distribution.html">
installing under VMS</A>. <P>

There is a lot of <A HREF="../../../Dist/bin">precompiled binary
versions</A> available in the subdirectory corresponding to your
machine architecture. <P>

If you prefer the source code, the the latest source code is available
in the following formats:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../../../Dist/src/WWWLineMode.tar.Z">compressed tar file</A>
<LI><A HREF="../../../Dist/src/WWWLineMode.tar.gz">gzip'ed tar file</A>
<LI><A HREF="../../../Dist/src/WWWLineMode.zip">zip file</A>
</UL>

from our <A HREF="../../../Dist">Destribution archives</A>. <P>

<IMG ALT="NOTE" SRC="../../Icons/32x32/warning.gif"> Please note that
you also need the <A HREF="../../Library/">W3C Reference Library</A>
in order to compile the browser.

<H2>Unpacking</H2>

Unpacking the destributions file depends on which source destribution
file you got (compressed tar file, gzip'ed tar file, or a zip
file). However, in any case you need to unpack both the <A
HREF="../../Library/">W3C Reference Library</A> and the Line Mode
Browser.

<H3>compressed tar file</H3>

<PRE>
        uncompress WWWLineMode.tar.Z
        tar xvf WWWLineMode.tar

        uncompress WWWLibrary.tar.Z
        tar xvf WWWLibrary.tar
</PRE>

<H3>gzip'ed tar file</H3>

<PRE>
        gunzip WWWLineMode.tar.gz
        tar xvf WWWLineMode.tar

        gunzip WWWLibrary.tar.gz
        tar xvf WWWLibrary.tar
</PRE>

<H3>zip file</H3>

<PRE>
        unzip WWWLineMode.zip

        unzip WWWLibrary.zip
</PRE>

<H2>Compilation</H2>

The compilation and linking of the browser is done using the <A
HREF="../../Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">BUILD script</A> which
figures out what platform you are using. If you have build earlier
versions of the W3C software and you already have a <CODE>WWW</CODE>
directory then it is <EM>very</EM> important that you do the
following:

<PRE>
	cd WWW
	make clobber
	./BUILD linemode
</PRE>

in order to make sure that all new code is built. If not then go to
newly-created <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory, and type:

<PRE>
        ./BUILD linemode
</PRE>

If you encounter problems during compilation or your don't have
the compiler which the <EM>BUILD</EM> script uses then then please
read the section on <A
HREF="../../Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">how to modify the
<EM>BUILD</EM> script</A>. <P>

The executable browser, "www" appears in the directory

<PRE>
	../WWW/LineMode/&lt;your.platform&gt;
</PRE>

As an example, in case your platform is SunOs, the directory is
"sun4".

<H2>Customization</H2>

Copy "www" into an appropriate directory which appears in your
path. If you can be superuser, this can be /usr/local/bin/www
(typically) so that everyone can use "www". If you type "rehash", you
will be able to use "www". It will start at a default home page which
is at W3C. <P>

You must now check that the default homepage works, and <A
HREF="Customisation.html">customize it</A> if it is not what you
want. The default home page just a place to start.
