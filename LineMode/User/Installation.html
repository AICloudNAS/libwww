<H1>Installation Guide</H1>

<HR>

This section describes how to install the World-Wide Web <A
HREF="../">Line Mode Browser</A> called "www".

<H2>Getting the Program</H2>

Often you don't need to compile the browser yourself, precompiled
binaries are available for many Unix platforms.  If there is no
precompiled version for your platform, of if it doesn't work (e.g. the
name resolution doesn't work), you should get the source code and
compile it yourself. There are <A HREF="Installation_VMS.html">special
instructions for VMS</A> if you are <A
HREF="http://delonline.cern.ch/disk$user/duns/doc/vms/distribution.html">
installing under VMS</A>.  <P>

<UL>

<LI>There is a lot of <A HREF="/pub/bin">precompiled versions</A>
available in the subdirectory corresponding to your machine
architecture. <P>

<LI>The browser is also available as <A
HREF="/pub/src/WWWLineMode.tar.Z">WWWLineMode.tar.Z</A> from our <A
HREF="/pub/src">source archive</A>. Please note that you also need
the <A HREF="../../../Libra../">WWW Library of Common
Code</A> in order to compile the browser. The Library is available
from <A HREF="/pub/src/WWWLibrary.tar.Z">WWWLibrary.tar.Z</A><P>

</UL>

<H2>Compilation</H2>

<OL>
<LI> Uncompress and untar the distribution tar files:

<PRE>
        uncompress WWWLineMode.tar.Z
        tar xvf WWWLineMode.tar
</PRE>

and

<PRE>
        uncompress WWWLibrary.tar.Z
        tar xvf WWWLibrary.tar
</PRE>

<LI><LI>The compilation and linking of the server is done using the <A
HREF="../../Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">BUILD script</A>
which figures out what platform you are using. If you have build
earlier versions of the CERN software and you already have a
<CODE>WWW</CODE> directory then it is <EM>very</EM> important that you
do the following:

<PRE>
	cd WWW
	make clobber
	./BUILD linemode
</PRE>

in order to make sure that all new code is built. If not then go to
newly-created <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory, and give command the
<CODE>./BUILD linemode</CODE>:

<PRE>
        cd WWW
        ./BUILD linemode
</PRE>

<LI>If you encounter problems during compilation or your don't have
the compiler which the <EM>BUILD</EM> script uses then then please
read the section on <A
HREF="../../Library/User/Platform/Porting.html">how to modify the
<EM>BUILD</EM> script</A>.

<LI> Executable <CODE>www</CODE> appears in directory
<CODE>../WWW/LineMode/sun4</CODE> (if you have a Sun4 machine), or in
another subdirectory corresponding to your machine architecture.

</OL>

<H2>Customization</H2>

Copy www into an appropriate directory which appears in your path. If
you can be superuser, this can be /usr/local/bin/www (typically) so
that everyone can use "www". If you type "rehash", you will be able to
use www. It will start at a default home page which is at CERN. <P>

You must now check that the default homepage works, and <A
HREF="Customisation.html">customize it</A> if it is not what you
want. The default home page just a place to start.
