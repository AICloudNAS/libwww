<DL>

<DT>Better error reporting
 
<DD>Difficult when many possible paths have been tried. Save log of
attempts? Portability of error message generation?

<DT>Command wanted: Append

<DD>to a given file a hypertext reference to the document.

<DT>Anchors in paper prints

<DD>If the user needs to print out documents when following links,
instead of inserting anchor numbers, insert page numbers of the
destination nodes, as they would appear in the printed document. Do
this by first following the links with no output on the screen,
reading all the files into the buffer and calculating the page
numbers.  Then go through the path again, with output directed to the
printer, inserting the corresponding page numbers rather than the
anchor numbers.

<DT>Deal with lists within lists

<DD>This is a part of having a better HTML parser

<DT>Style sheets

<DD>Nested style sheets like everybody is asking for

</UL>
