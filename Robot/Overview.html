<DIV class="intro">
  The W3C Mini Robot is a cross platform command line tool for accessing the
  Web. It is developed in C and serves as an example of a client application
  using the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Sample Code Library</A> and as a test-tool
  for quick access to the Web from scripts, cron jobs etc. It gives a variety
  of possibilities for data format conversion, filtering etc. It is primarily
  intended as a test-tool for quick access to the Web or used in scripts, cron
  jobs etc.

    Used as an example application for the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Sample Code
    Library</A>. The robot is the primary tool used for the
    <A HREF="../Protocols/HTTP/Performance/">HTTP performance measurements</A>.
    Check for example <A HREF="../Protocols/HTTP/Performance/LAN/">the performance
    on a LAN</A>.

    Plans
  <DD>
    New releases follows the releases of the <A HREF="../Library/">W3C Sample
    Code Library</A> very closely.
  <DT>
    Platforms
  <DD>
    The application is known to compile on the following
    <A HREF="../Library/User/Platform/">Platforms</A>. See also special notes
    on <A HREF="../Library/User/Platform/WinDLL.html">Windows</A>

    Getting the Source Code
  <DD>
    This application is part of the <A HREF="../Library/Distribution.html">libwww
    distribution package</A> which you can get from the
    <A HREF="../Library/">Library top page</A>. You can see how to unpack and
    compile the software in the <A HREF="../README.html">README</A> file, and
    you can find more information on how the W3C Sample Code Library is designed
    in the <A HREF="../Library/User/Architecture/">Library Architecture</A> and
    how to use it in the <A HREF="../Library/User/Using/">User's Guide</A>.

  <A NAME="How">How to Run</A>
</H2>
<P>
Be careful - this is a robot and hence can be used to traverse many links
- it should not be used for anything but
<A HREF="../Protocols/HTTP/Forum/">HTTP/1.1 testing</A>. Especially, it doesn't
follow directions indicated in <TT>robot.txt</TT> files and hence should
not be used on the Internet at large.
<P>
The robot has a large set of <A HREF="User/CommandLine.html">command line
options</A> that can be used in a large set of different combinations. You
can try and <A HREF="src/robot.sh">see this simple script</A> in order to
see an example of how it can be run.
