  The W3C Web Database
</H1>
<P>
Here you can find information about broken links, redirections, document
titles, last modified dates, content types, link relationships and much much
more. The information is extracted from an SQL database as you go along.
This SQL database is built and maintained by the libwww robot which travseres
the site approximately every night.
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B><A HREF="links.sql">Link Relationships</A></B>
  <DD>
    Here you can find which resources point to which resources - both incoming
    and outgoing links as well as search for different link types.
  <DT>
    <B><A href="requests.sql">Request Information</A></B>
  <DD>
    Here you can find all the information that the libwww robot gathered from
    the Web requests issued when traversing our site.
  <DT>
    <B><A href="resources.sql">Resources Information</A></B>
  <DD>
    Here you can find a lot of metainformation about the resources that we are
    serving including content type, last modified date, etc.
  <DT>
    <B><A href="fixme.sql">Broken HTML, Bad Style, etc.</A></B>
  <DD>
    Find out what is wrong about your pages and where the problems are
</DL>
<P>
This tool uses a <A href="http://www.tcx.se/">MySQL</A> database runnning
on localhost and the Web interface is provided by
<A href="http://www.daa.com.au/~james/www-sql/">www-sql</A>.
<P>
The index is approximately updated either early in the morning or late in
the evening, but there is no automated process in place as it is running
against my own machine.
<P>
Have fun!
